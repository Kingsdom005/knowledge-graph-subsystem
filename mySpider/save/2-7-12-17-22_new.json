In the early Western Zhou period (c. 1046–977 BCE), it became popular for the ding legs to take the form of birds. In this example, the shallow bowl with a round bottom is supported by three flattened legs, each rendered in the form of a bird standing upon its claws and tail. Above the legs is a row of cicadas. Perhaps because the life cycle of the cicada was seen as symbolic of renewed life—they lie dormant underground for seven to 14 years, and emerge for only one summer—the insect was a popular motif during the Shang and Zhou dynasties, commonly represented in bronze and jades.", "web_url": "https://collections.artsmia.org/art/816", "img_url": "https://6.api.artsmia.org/816.jpg", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:06:40"},

In the Ming dynasty, soapstone became the preferred material of the literati. Scholars readily carved the soft material in their personal calligraphic styles. Like literati paintings, seals expressed the taste and personality of their owners. The squared, angular characters and simple, forceful calligraphy in these examples were inspired by Han dynasty (2nd century BCE–2nd century CE) script, which along with bronze inscriptions and other early styles of calligraphy was studied and emulated by the wen ren.

By discarding the complex shapes and flamboyant ornament associated with western Asiatic taste, Tang potters created green, white and black ceramics that reassert a native preference for simple forms and single uniform colors. These aesthetic values, in turn, led to the great celadon and monochrome porcelains of the subsequent Song and Qing dynasties.", "web_url": "https://collections.artsmia.org/art/4698", "img_url": "https://6.api.artsmia.org/4698.jpg", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 17:26:13"},

Accompanying the Anglo-French expeditionary force, which went on to seize Beijing and force the Chinese Empire to accede to sweeping political and economic demands, Beato’s views, combining topographical and military information, provided a visual record of the Imperial campaign.  They were often included in ‘progress’ reports sent from Hong Kong to the commanding officer of the British army.\r\n\r\nBeato also sold his images of China to British officers as unmounted prints with his stock number, title, and date written in pencil on the verso of each print.  By assembling a selection of images, the purchaser could construct a personal visual record.  Surviving albums such as this one have differing numbers of prints, and are a reflection of the owner's personal military career.  But even before the ‘narrative’ was constructed by the purchaser, Beato himself controlled the story, determining what was considered worthy of recording and eliminating any conflicting viewpoints. These views were absorbed by the public as part of a larger visual memory documenting England’s rise as an Imperial power.\r\n", "comments": "Albumen print from wet collodion on glass negative", "web_url": "https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1096305", "img_url": "https://framemark.vam.ac.uk/collections/2015HV7663/full/!100,100/0/default.jpg", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 15:50:52"},

The gates shown here marked the entrance to 'New China Street', a street created in 1823 after the city had suffered a devastating fire in the preceding year. On the right is the 'Spanish Factory', and on the left (beyond the gates) is the 'Danish Factory', near the western end of the 'Factory site' to which Western merchants were confined.  In the foreground an itinerant barber attends to a customer. \r\n Chinnery himself had arrived in 1825 at Macau some 70 miles below Canton at the mouth of the Pearl River estuary; from here he paid several visits to the Canton 'factories' between 1825 and 1832.\r\n   George Chinnery (1774-1852) was born in London, the son of a writing master with artistic ambition, who exhibited portraits at the Free Society of Artists in 1764 and 1766. Chinnery established himself as a miniature painter (small portraits in watercolour on ivory), exhibiting miniature portraits at the Royal Academy from 1791 to 1795.  In 1796 he moved to Dublin, where he had some relations, marrying there in 1799.  He began to paint landscapes and large portraits in oil. The abolition of the Irish parliament in 1800 led many of Dublin's wealthier inhabitants to leave the city, and perhaps for this reason, fearing the loss of potential patrons, Chinnery also left.  In 1802 he received permission from the East India company to travel from England to India, where he worked as a painter, leaving his wife and children behind in Britain.  He was initially based in Madras with his elder brother, a merchant and employee of the East India Company. Gradually he received more prestigious portrait commissions, and by 1812 he was established in Calcutta as the principal Western artist in the capital of British India.  His wife joined him there in 1818.  While in India he made many sketches in pencil of local life, people engaged in their everyday activities, and painted scenes of local architecture in watercolour.  Although he was successful and well paid, he was often in debt.  In 1825 he abandoned his wife and creditors and sailed for China.  He was based in the Portuguese enclave of Macau, which was to be his home for the rest of his life, apart from visits to Canton (modern Guangzhou), Whampoa and Hong Kong.  Trade between China and the West was centred on Canton, but Western merchants were only allowed to stay there briefly, and their families were based in Macau.  As in India, Chinnery sketched local scenes in pencil, painting finished topographical scenes in watercolour and in oil back in his studio.  He received commissions however for portraits of British merchants, especially those associated with the firm of Jardine, Matheson, and also painted Chinese, Portuguese, American, Swedish and Parsi sitters.  Chinnery's Chinese sitters included many Cantonese \"hong merchants\" who were responsible for all dealings with Western traders.  As Hong Kong developed in the 1840s the Western traders and their families began to move from Macau to the new settlement.  But Chinnery chose to stay in his home in Macau and died there in 1852 from a stroke.

He also established what was to become the largest photographic printing business in England.  This image is part of the V&A's Francis Frith 'Universal Series' archive which consists of over 4000 whole-plate albumen prints predominantly of historical and topographical sites.  Images such as these were highly desirable throughout the 1850s and 1860s. \n\nIt is now known that nearly all of the works bearing the F. Frith and Co. stamp were not taken by Frith himself, but by one of his travelling employees.  Photographers associated with Frith's 'Universal Series' include Robert Napper (Andalusia), Frank Mason Good (Egypt) and Frederick William Sutton and Hugo Lewis Pearson (Japan).  In addition to hiring his own photographers, Frith also bought the negative stocks of established photographers such as Roger Fenton and Francis Bedford.  \n\nThe images that make up the V&A Frith 'Universal Series' are file prints acquired from F. Frith & Co. Ltd of Reigate, Surrey.  Mounted on brown card, with the place name and stock number usually handwritten on the print itself, they were most probably used as place-markers within the company's filing system, allowing for easy retrieval of stocks of unmounted prints.\n\nFrith's growing business coincided with many technological developments taking place within the field of photography. These developments changed and expanded the audience for photography and Frith's operation was well-prepared to provide for it and, it can be argued, worked to develop it employing a diverse range of publishing channels.  Targeted towards a market that would later adopt the postcard as the ideal format for its needs, the 'Universal Series' forms a bridge between the initial low volume craft/art production associated with photography of the 1850s and the more commercial mass production work of the latter half of the century.", "comments": "Whole-plate albumen print from wet collodion glass negative", "web_url": "https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O215278", "img_url": "https://framemark.vam.ac.uk/collections/2008BW0908/full/!100,100/0/default.jpg", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 15:54:24"},

It is part of the Robert Freidus collection of paper models, donated to the museum.\r\n\r\nThe Robert Freidus Paper Model Collection contains in excess of 12,000 models of architectural structures. These models remain in their unmade state. The models vary from simple press-out shapes, to more complex objects that require cutting, folding and sticking to produce their intended shape. The models come in various forms; boxed sets, postcards, pages from magazines, and jig-saw puzzles. The collection includes a large number of famous landmarks, versions of which have been produced by many manufacturers. But some models are less well known, including fictional locations from television programmes, and one amateur designer’s own house.

Accompanying the Anglo-French expeditionary force, which went on to seize Beijing and force the Chinese Empire to accede to sweeping political and economic demands, Beato’s views, combining topographical and military information, provided a visual record of the Imperial campaign.  They were often included in ‘progress’ reports sent from Hong Kong to the commanding officer of the British army.\r\n\r\nBeato also sold his images of China to British officers as unmounted prints with his stock number, title, and date written in pencil on the verso of each print.  By assembling a selection of images, the purchaser could construct a personal visual record.  Surviving albums such as this one have differing numbers of prints, and are a reflection of the owner's personal military career.

It is part of the Robert Freidus collection of paper models, donated to the museum.\r\n\r\nThe Robert Freidus Paper Model Collection contains in excess of 12,000 models of architectural structures. These models remain in their unmade state. The models vary from simple press-out shapes, to more complex objects that require cutting, folding and sticking to produce their intended shape. The models come in various forms; boxed sets, postcards, pages from magazines, and jig-saw puzzles. The collection includes a large number of famous landmarks, versions of which have been produced by many manufacturers. But some models are less well known, including fictional locations from television programmes, and one amateur designer’s own house. Some publishers focus on a specific genre of buildings such as lighthouses while others set out to illustrate types of houses and buildings rather than specific examples.\r\n\r\nThe first paper models, those to be cut out from a sheet and assembled, appeared in Europe in the 17th Century, The earliest commercial models were recorded appearing in French toy catalogues in 1800. From then on paper models became popular across Europe particularly in Germany, and in the later half of the century, the UK. Manufacturers such as Pellerin and Schreiber began producing series of hundreds of models, from famous landmarks to farmhouses and specific scenes. Originally designed for children, paper models gave their owners the chance to learn about places and people in other parts of the world. The best example of this is Milton Bradley’s Village series produced in the late 19th and early 20th Century, which showed the people of a particular country and the houses they lived in. \r\n\r\nTowards the end of the 20th Century paper modelling became increasingly popular with an adult audience with many kits being designed for a more sophisticated modeller. During this time television tie-ins also started appearing on the market reflecting the emerging trend of media merchandising. More recently with the development of the Internet, models have appeared online and these have been printed and added to the collection. Some of these models are stand alone items, while others can be used with model railways or in fantasy role playing games.

She completed her BA in Ceramic Art at the Nanjing University of the Arts and her MA at the Jingdezhen Ceramic Institute. She has received critical acclaim both in China and abroad, notably in winning the Sidney Myer Fund Premier Award at the Shepparton Art Museum, Victoria, Australia, in 2004, and participating in the international exhibition 1001 Cups in 2010 that travelled from Switzerland to India, China and Korea.\n\nFrom around 2003, Jiang started to create anthropomorphic forms using moulded ceramic vessels, usually in the shape of ancient Chinese figurines. In 2012, she began the Banquet series during her residency at Gaochun Ceramic Factory in Jiangsu province that produces bone china tableware. Using the factory’s raw material, Jiang developed her ideas further by incorporating shapes from the factory’s mass produced tableware in her works, such as the knob on the teapot lid, which are visible in this piece. There is an element of humour in her pieces, as the solemn shapes that are reminiscent of Han-dynasty tomb figurines are reconstructed in cartoonish forms. At the same time, the piece speaks to the centrality of vessels in the performance of ritualised social relationships, in the past, and in contemporary life.

He also established what was to become the largest photographic printing business in England.  This image is part of the V&A's Francis Frith 'Universal Series' archive which consists of over 4000 whole-plate albumen prints predominantly of historical and topographical sites.  Images such as these were highly desirable throughout the 1850s and 1860s. \n\nIt is now known that nearly all of the works bearing the F. Frith and Co. stamp were not taken by Frith himself, but by one of his travelling employees.  Photographers associated with Frith's 'Universal Series' include Robert Napper (Andalusia), Frank Mason Good (Egypt) and Frederick William Sutton and Hugo Lewis Pearson (Japan).  In addition to hiring his own photographers, Frith also bought the negative stocks of established photographers such as Roger Fenton and Francis Bedford.  \n\nThe images that make up the V&A Frith 'Universal Series' are file prints acquired from F. Frith & Co. Ltd of Reigate, Surrey.  Mounted on brown card, with the place name and stock number usually handwritten on the print itself, they were most probably used as place-markers within the company's filing system, allowing for easy retrieval of stocks of unmounted prints.\n\nFrith's growing business coincided with many technological developments taking place within the field of photography. These developments changed and expanded the audience for photography and Frith's operation was well-prepared to provide for it and, it can be argued, worked to develop it employing a diverse range of publishing channels.  Targeted towards a market that would later adopt the postcard as the ideal format for its needs, the 'Universal Series' forms a bridge between the initial low volume craft/art production associated with photography of the 1850s and the more commercial mass production work of the latter half of the century.", "comments": "Whole-plate albumen print from wet collodion glass negative", "web_url": "https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O215275", "img_url": "https://framemark.vam.ac.uk/collections/2008BW0905/full/!100,100/0/default.jpg", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:03:41"},

Slater's slightly earlier 'Vogue' shape, though very modern and fashionably geometric, received some criticism for its infilled triangular cup handles which people found difficult to hold. Slater responded to the criticism with 'Regent', designed in 1932, and it soon became the most popular Shelley design.

The replica was specially made for the Museum of Manufactures at Marlborough House. It was acquired because of its 'successful turquoise colour' and as an example of 'the highest state of English ceramic manufacture'. Queen Victoria had been so struck by the appearance of the original service when she attended the preview of the Great Exhibition that she purchased it. After the close of the Exhibition she presented it to the Emperor of Austria. It can now be seen in the Hofsilber -und Tafelkammer at the Hofburg in Vienna.\r\n\r\nThe combination of glazed and decorated bone china with unglazed Parian figures was praised by the Great Exhibition jury for its 'original design, high degree of beauty and harmony of effect', though some objected to it. John Tallis, in his History and Description of the Crystal Palace (1852) also praises the 'bleu celeste' (turquoise colour) as being 'scarcely inferior to that of old Sèvres', which it was largely emulating.\r\n\r\nThe parian figures on this sugar bowl are the work of the designer and figure-modeller, Pierre-Emile Jeannest (1813-1857) who was the son of a French bronzier and pupil of Delaroche. He worked for Minton for several years between about 1848 and 1854. The painting was probably executed by Thomas Kirkby (1824-1890) who was a leading Minton painter and designer who spent over 50 years with the factory.", "comments": "parian and glazed bone china, painted and gilt", "web_url": "https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O180260", "img_url": "https://framemark.vam.ac.uk/collections/2008BT2264/full/!100,100/0/default.jpg", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:04:52"},

It is part of the Robert Freidus collection of paper models, donated to the museum.\r\n\r\nThe Robert Freidus Paper Model Collection contains in excess of 12,000 models of architectural structures. These models remain in their unmade state. The models vary from simple press-out shapes, to more complex objects that require cutting, folding and sticking to produce their intended shape. The models come in various forms; boxed sets, postcards, pages from magazines, and jig-saw puzzles. The collection includes a large number of famous landmarks, versions of which have been produced by many manufacturers. But some models are less well known, including fictional locations from television programmes, and one amateur designer’s own house.

Canton \"Hong\" Bowl, China, c. 1785, porcelain.\nCollection of Asian Civilisations Museum.\nPorcelain bowls of this type that depict the hongs (行) or trading companies of Western merchants at the port city of Canton (today's Guangzhou) were produced by Chinese artisans for export to Western markets by way of Canton. This piece is a fine example that not only vividly conveys the beautiful scene at Canton, but also documents the trade between China and the West during the 18th and 19th centuries.\nCanton is important in the history of global trade because for about 100 years between the mid-1700s and mid-1800s, it was the sole source of Chinese luxury goods such as tea, silks, lacquer and porcelain. The Dutch and British established their ports of Batavia and Singapore in Southeast Asia respectively to take advantage of the Canton trade. These ports functioned as entrepôts for the re-export of Chinese luxury goods to the West.\nIn 1842, the first Opium War erupted near the port of Canton. In the aftermath and the decades to come, China was forced to sign a series of Unequal Treaties that saw many of its coastal ports—such as Amoy (Xiamen), Foochow (Fuzhou), Shanghai, Hong Kong, and of course, Canton—open up for international trade. It is from these \"treaty ports\" that Singapore's Chinese population of Hokkiens, Cantonese, Teochew, Hokchiew, Hakka (and others) arrived in the 1800s and 1900s.\nThis is an extract from \"The Singapore Story through 60 objects\" written by Kennie Ting, Director, Asian Civilisations Museum and Peranakan Museum & Group Director of Museums, National Heritage Board.

Born in Yixing, Jiangsu Province, in 1919, Wu studied at the Hangzhou National College of Art in 1936. He was trained in oil and ink painting, and graduated from the academy in 1942. From 1947 to 1950, he travelled to Paris to study at the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts on a government scholarship. In 2008, Wu donated to Singapore's National Collection 113 oil and ink paintings. This was the largest group donation Wu has made to a public institution. Singapore's collection of Wu Guanzhong now totals 129 pieces and spans through six decades of his artistic career.\nZhangjiajie (张家界) is the largest artwork by Wu Guanzhong in our National Collection.

The beautifully fluid drapery was finished with deeply carved folds, which emphasise the simple but voluminous style of the high official’s robe. His portly stature is indicated by the rank badges that were worn by court officials of the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911) dynasties.\nWen Chang is thought to have lived in the Tang (618–906) or Jin (1115–1234) dynasties before he was subsequently deified. He was worshipped by scholars hoping for fortuitous examination results. Today, school children in Singapore put letters at his feet listing the examination subjects and results that they hope to achieve.\nDehua, located on the southeast coast of Fujian province, is well known for its production of white porcelain, known to Europeans as 'blanc de Chine'.

A Pair of Horses, Xu Beihong, China, c. 1940, Chinese ink and colour on paper.\nXiang Xue Zhuang Collection, in memory of Dr Tan Tsze Chor, collection of Asian Civilisations Museum.\nThe late Dr Tan Tsze Chor was one of a small group of collectors and businessmen in Singapore who were strong supporters of the arts, and were inspired by ancient examples of the Chinese literati class of painter-calligrapher-cum-collectors. He named his collection and studio Xiang Xue Zhuang 香雪庄. The collection was known for its works from the masters of Chinese painting (in particular Xu Beihong, Ren Bonian and painters of the Shanghai School), ancient paintings and calligraphy from the Song to the Qing dynasties, transitional period (17th century) blue and white ceramics, Yixing wares, inkstones and Qi Baishi inkseals. The collection at the Asian Civilisations Museum consists of more than 100 of these paintings and scholarly objects, generously donated by the Tan family since 2000.\nThis painting of a pair of horses by Xu Beihong is one of the highlights of the collection. Although Xu Beihong was celebrated for his paintings of horses, he once said that he painted so many of them only because people liked them. They were indeed well received in Singapore in 1939 as many paintings of horses were said to be executed then. Xu's horses came to represent the indomitable spirit of China in the face of the Japanese invasions during late 1930s and early 1940s. This symbolism was apt as Xu was a patriot who raised money for the anti-Japanese movement through the sale of his works. Xu's horses are awe-inspiring and show his mature handling of the brush. The musculature of the horses in every pose as well as their dignity and elegance, are accurately defined in just a few key strokes.\nThis is an extract from \"The Singapore Story through 60 objects\" written by Kennie Ting, Director, Asian Civilisations Museum and Peranakan Museum & Group Director of Museums, National Heritage Board.

The ethereal sounds make up an ancient music form that was first conceived as an amalgamation of court and religious music. This is the ancient music of Zhihua Temple, an oral tradition that has been passed down 27 generations over 500 years. And this form of music is one of the most unique among the myriad of sacred sounds in 2016's A Tapestry of Sacred Music. Curious? We tell you why you should experience this art form. Discover the \"living fossil\" of ancient Chinese music In the 1950s, a Zhihua monk discovered an ancient music book at the bottom of a chest. After some investigation, it was confirmed that it was a transcript made in 1694 by a musician-monk, Yang Yongqian. The scores in the book are exactly the same as the music performed today. Having originated in the courts of the Ming Dynasty, this music has remained almost untouched in spite of changes in China’s cultural landscape over 500 years. It therefore gives us a rare glimpse into the history and sounds of ancient China. Did you know…This music was meant for royalty, not commoners. It was taken from the courts to the temples without the Emperor’s permission by Wang Zhen, the first Ming Dynasty eunuch with power in the court. He ordered that the Zhihua Temple be built in 1443. Appreciate the art of jing yinyue The music, often referred to as jing yinyue (Beijing music, a Buddhist genre) has distinctive artistic features, such as an elegant and grand tonal system, and a rich performance style. A slow and steady rhythm builds a tranquil ambience, meant to ease your emotional state and help in meditation. Meet the 27th generation of temple musicians Appreciation for the Beijing music that the temple is known for is waning. Adding to the challenge of preserving its existing repertoire, the lack of successors does not bode well for the future. Owing to the Cultural Revolution in the late '60s and '70s, many Zhihua monks left to resume secular lives following the founding of the People's Republic of China. The temple restructured its policies: students learning the art no longer needed to be monks. Did you know...The current generation of musicians are not monks, but they are passionate about the art form, and strive to take in more disciples to continue this disappearing tradition. See ancient instruments come to life The musicians perform on age-old wind and percussion instruments that were used in the courts. These include the taigu (drums), yunluo (a collection of ten mini-gongs), guanzi (an ancient Chinese oboe with nine holes, popular during the Ming Dynasty), sheng (mouth-blown reed flute) and dizi (traverse flute). Today, the ensemble has downsized from nine to just six. Did you know…The sheng is used today in Chinese orchestras but the one used by these temple musicians dates back to the Song Dynasty and has only 17 reed pipes. Hear some of the last 39 pieces of traditional temple music Out of 300 known pieces of music, less than 50 are transcribed in hand-copied notation books. Each piece is passed down orally, through performance. As traditional notation only sets the “frame” notes, much of the more nuanced supplementary notes called kou (mouth) are required. Of the scores that survived, some include vocal sections that nobody knows how to sing. Today, only 39 pieces are complete enough to be performed.

The incised lozenge motif with leafy fronds is an Iranian design seen on other objects in the wreck, which suggests that much of the cargo was destined for the Middle East. The overall form of the ewer is based on objects made in metal, as is evident from the rim surrounding the base, and the thinness of the handle.\nThe Tang Shipwreck cargo contains more than 70,000 pieces of ceramics, gold, silver and other items, of which some 55,000 pieces are presently in the National Collection. The ship carrying this cargo was an Arab or Persian dhow; the ship had been built using techniques still used today in the Gulf, particularly in Oman. The collection is cross-cultural in nature, since it consists of a Chinese cargo bound for the Middle East, borne in a Middle Eastern ship that sunk in Southeast Asia, very near Singapore.\n  This is an extract from \"The Singapore Story through 60 objects\" written by Kennie Ting, Director, Asian Civilisations Museum and Peranakan Museum & Group Director of Museums, National Heritage Board.

These leaders were appointed by the government to manage the civil affairs of their communities. They were termed “officers” and held the ranks of ‘majoor’, ‘kapitein’ or ‘luitenant’. Woodbury and Page was a photo studio founded by Englishmen Walter Bentley Woodbury and James Page in Batavia (now Jakarta) on 5 June 1857. The younger Woodbury brothers, Henry James and Albert, joined the enterprise subsequently. It remained active right up to 1908, even after the departure of its original owners. In addition to studio portraits, Woodbury and Page also travelled around the Dutch East Indies, capturing a range of subjects which included royal personages, the common people, landscapes and scenes of everyday life. Though they were not the earliest photographers in Java, their prolific works are now considered classic and lauded for providing valuable insights into Indonesia in the colonial era.Apart from being an avid photographer, Woodbury was also famous for inventing a photo developing technique, which was patented as the Woodburytype on 23 September 1864. He took out no less than 20 patents between 1864 and 1884 and was dubbed the ‘Einstein of photography’ by his peers.", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/Collection-Landing/listing/1216449", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/CollectionImages/1216449.jpg", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:09"},

They were used as portable room dividers or backdrops for social gatherings. This particular screen incorporates European stylistic features such as the carved leafy scroll decoration atop the wooden frame and the use of upholstered panels. European-style Chinese furniture was popular among the Straits Chinese communities living in Singapore from the late 19th century onwards. The upholstery as well as etched glass panels with bird-and-flower designs are, however, not original to this wooden screen. The original glass and upholstered panels were probably changed due to age or damage in the course of their use.", "comments": "Gift of the Tye family, direct descendants of Tye Kee Yoon 戴喜云, Vice Consul of China in Penang and Lew Yuk Lin 刘玉麟， Minister of the Republic of China to London.", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/Collection-Landing/listing/1397661", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/CollectionImages/1397661.jpg", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:11"},

TL;DR\nPhilanthropic tycoon Tan Kah Kee (21 October 1874-12 August 1961) whom a MRT station is named after, was a larger-than-life kind of guy. When he died in Beijing, China, the Chinese government held a national funeral in honour of his contributions.1 What did he achieve in his lifetime exactly? His businesses created jobs for more than 30,000 people in Singapore and abroad. Tan, who married four times, lobbied against the war-bent Japanese, set up 100 educational institutions2, and also found the time to establish two newspapers.\nSingapore’s Very Own Henry Ford\nTan Kah Kee left his home town in Fujian, China for Singapore at the age of 16, having received a Confucian-centric education.\nAt work, Tan was diligent, rising through the ranks of Chop Soon Ann, his father’s rice mill and sundries business in Singapore.3 By the 1900s, his father’s business ventures began to falter4 as a result of misappropriation and mismanagement. Tan worked to shut the companies down and was singularly focused on clearing their debts.\nTan later built his own empire. From a single pineapple canning factory, Tan soon had three such enterprises under his name.5 With these successes, he was able to buy back the original home of Chop Soon Ann in North Boat Quay.6 There, he established the Khiam Aik rice mill.7 When his businesses faced setbacks, he branched out into new markets and other sectors, staying nimble and conscious of global trends. At one point, his empire comprised pineapple and rubber plantations, rice mills and a biscuit factory. Tan also got involved in the shipping industry as well as the manufacture of tyres and shoes.8\nTan later built his own empire.

At one point, his empire comprised pineapple and rubber plantations, rice mills and a biscuit factory. Tan also got involved in the shipping industry as well as the manufacture of tyres and shoes.8\nIn the mid-1920s, Tan’s empire created jobs for more than 30,000 people in Singapore and beyond. His success was attributed to his fastidious nature and involvement in all stages of the supply chain — much like Henry Ford, the great industrialist.9 Tan took several employees under his wing, his mentorship and tutelage leading to the rise of other movers and shakers such as Lee Kong Chian and Tan Lark Sye.10\nTan’s businesses wound up “naturally”, having been impacted by international financial cycles and catastrophes such as the Great Depression.11 Historian Wang Gungwu, who described Tan as “one of the earliest global Chinese entrepreneurs that the Nanyang produced”, said it was precisely because of the global reach of his businesses that Tan was subjected to such crashes.12\nInstead of resting on his laurels, Tan reinvented himself to serve his communities in Singapore and China.\nTan Kah Kee. (Image from the National Archives of Singapore)\nConfucian consciousness\nA firm believer in education as a social leveller, and continually guided by Confucian values, Tan was involved in setting up more than 10 schools and institutes such as Tao Nan School, Ai Tong School, and The Chinese High School (now Haw Chong Institution after a merger with Hwa Chong Junior College)13 in Singapore. In China, he pushed for the establishment of Xiamen University.14\nJimei Secondary School which was established by Tan Kah Kee in his hometown in Fujian, China. (Image from the National Archives of Singapore)\nTan Kah Kee giving a thank you speech at the Ee Hoe Hean Club in Bukit Pasoh in the 1940s. (Image from the National Archives of Singapore)\nIn 1923, Tan started Nanyang Siang Pau, a Chinese newspaper to encourage a reading culture and promote businesses. 15\nIn 1929, he was elected to serve as president of the Hokkien Huay Kuan.16 He used its platform to call for unity among Singapore’s varied Chinese dialect communities and to put an end to social ills such as opium addiction.\nHis mind was also on his home country. To this end, he set up a number of funds to provide relief for flooding victims, and to render aid following the outbreak of war between China and Japan in 1937. The following year, he served as head of the South-East Asia Federation of the China Relief Fund to further support the anti-war effort.\nWhen the Japanese reached Singapore in 1942, Tan rallied members of the Chinese community to aid the British in repelling the invaders.17 For all his anti-war efforts, Tan was a prime target of the Japanese and thus had little choice but to leave Singapore. He ended up in Marang, Indonesia where he spent his time writing.18\nTan Kah Kee writing a letter. (Image from the National Archives of Singapore)\nAfter the war, Tan returned to Singapore and launched the Nan Chiao Jit Poh, a newspaper which took on an unfavourable tone towards the ruling Kuomintang in China. The British, fearing that the growing politicisation of Chinese in Malaya and Singapore, grew increasingly apprehensive about individuals such as Tan.19 At one point, they even considered cancelling his British citizenship.20 Tan left Singapore for China in 1950, and in 1957, renounced his British citizenship. In China, he dedicated his resources towards rebuilding and reconstruction efforts.\nWhen he died in Beijing, China at 87, Tan was given a state funeral by the Chinese government to honour his contributions. His final resting place is in Ao Yuan, Jimei, China. In Singapore he’s remembered in various ways. For instance, a train station which opened in Bukit Timah in 2015 bears his name.\nTan Kah Kee holed himself up in this house in Marang, Indonesia during World War II.

Issue 1\nA silver flask from the Tang dynasty (618–907) was one of many luxurious metalware recovered from a shipwreck that had occurred over 1,100 years ago off Sumatra. Besides their opulent appeal, gold and silver vessels were also popular among the Tang elite because it was believed that drinking and eating from them would enhance one’s longevity.\n  This particular flask is notable for its large size and intricate workmanship.

Another dull brown substance found atop the flask’s base was identified to be an acrylic polymer. Since acrylic was only invented after the Tang dynasty, it was likely from later alterations.

A mound sighted. An accidental and amazing discovery was made. Text by Kan Shu Yi\nBeMuse Volume 5 Issue 2 – Apr to Jun 2012\nA dive for sea cucumbers. A mound sighted. An accidental and amazing discovery was made.\nLying silent for more than a millennium underwater, a chance discovery by local fishermen in 1998 brought the Belitung cargo to light. The wreck was found in relatively shallow waters at a site approximately 17 metres deep and a few kilometres off the shores of Belitung Island in the Java Sea. Tragedy probably struck when the ship crashed into reefs in the area, referred to as Batu Hitam (‘black rock’).\nAuthorised by the Indonesia government, salvagers proceeded to recover some 60,000 objects from the wreck site over two seasons of excavation work. The bulk of the finds were Chinese ceramics from the Tang period (618 – 907), comprising both mass produced and rare examples. Bullion in the form of silver and lead ingots was also found. The most astonishing finds were perhaps the exquisite pieces of Chinese metalwork – gold, silver, and bronze – which suggested that the people on board had a connection with the highest strata of Tang society.\nFour-lobed box with mandarin ducks. China, ca. 830, partly gilded silver. Tang Shipwreck Treasure: Singapore's Maritime Collection.\nPhotograph by John Tsantes & Robb Harrell, Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, Smithsonian Institution.\nThe extraordinary nature of this find was heightened by the vessel itself. Examination of the ship’s construction methods and analysis of its timbers revealed that the ship was most likely to be of Arab origin. The ship’s hull were formed by planks sewn together using vegetal fibres instead of iron fastenings, the latter a feature of Chinese ships. The timbers, consisting of African hardwoods, were common materials used by shipbuilders from the Gulf region. Thus, this shipwreck stands as the earliest Arab vessel to have been discovered in Southeast Asian waters, a testament to the bustling maritime trade and sprawling commercial networks during the ninth century.\nMaritime trade routes during the ninth century.\nYet, much remains a mystery. Just as the ship’s exact place of origin is undetermined, so is its final point of departure. It was probably Yangzhou (in Jiangsu province) or Guangzhou (in Guangdong province), both bustling trade hubs in ninth-century China, from which the Belitung ship sailed. And where was the ship heading when it ran into reefs off Belitung Island? It appears to have deviated from the main shipping route that most vessels took when traversing the region. Was it perhaps blown off course? Or had it taken another course to avoid pirates? More likely, it was dropping off ceramics or acquiring new trade products and provisions at a port in Java.\nHumble utilitarian items, which shed light on the lives of those on board, added another layer of interest to this discovery. The crew and other passengers on the vessel were most likely multinational. Arab or Persian traders probably chartered the ship, and brought with them vessels such as the turquoise-glazed amphora. On the long voyage, it would have made multiple stops in India and Southeast Asia to recruit new crew. There were most probably Chinese merchants on board also, as suggested by the inkstone used for writing.\nTurquoise-glazed amphora. Iraq or Iran, ca. 830, earthenware.

The ceramics found in the shipwreck are the types produced in the ninth century, a dating which matches the results of radiocarbon tests on organic materials from the wreck. A date equivalent to 826 is thought to be incised on one of the Changsha bowls. It is thus likely that the Belitung ship sailed in the second quarter of the ninth century, possibly within a few seasons of the bowl’s manufacture.\nBowl with incised inscription.

Tang Shipwreck Treasure: Singapore's Maritime Collection.\nPhotograph copyright Singapore Tourism Board.\nThe Cargo\nA commodity difficult for camels to transport via the overland Silk Road, shipping had made possible the large-scale export of ceramics from the mid-Tang dynasty. The Belitung ship carried close to 60,000 pieces of Chinese ceramics. But breakages were found at a relatively low level of approximately 20 percent, which suggests that there were more than 70,000 pieces of ceramics in the ship’s original cargo. This is an impressive figure considering that the vessel measured approximately 18 metres by 6.5 metres. It carried numerous storage jars, of which many with larger openings were packed with ceramic bowls. The manner of packing – many bowls were tightly arranged in a “helixical” manner and probably cushioned by straw – enabled the boat to carry such an enormous load. This packing method and the silt of the seabed also protected most of the cargo from damage.\nThe size of the cargo underscores the great popularity of Chinese ceramics, which were valued for their beauty, strength, and durability. These qualities were unrivalled by ceramics from other parts of the world. To cater to the growing demand, new kilns sprang up in many provinces in China, while old ones changed their technologies and products. For instance, there was a shift from producing low-fired tomb pottery to high-fired tableware. Assembled from diverse sources, the repertoire of wares in the cargo highlights the vitality and competitiveness of the Chinese ceramics industry. It also shows the merchants’ entrepreneurial ways as they targeted different groups of clientele by exporting a range of goods.\nChangsa Wares\nCeramics from the Changsha kilns in Hunan province dominated the cargo of the Belitung wreck. Approximately 57,500 items were produced by Changsha potters and among these were some 55,000 bowls. Most of these bowls carry one of a few basic patterns, which include foliage, flowers, birds, and clouds. However, these were created by many different artisans, hence giving an impression of a huge variety of designs that ranged from the realistic to the abstract. This staggering quantity of ceramics reflects the organisational and productive capacities of China’s ceramic industry. Relatively isolated from the Tang court, major commercial centres and other kilns, Changsha potters developed a distinctive decorative style, featuring lively designs painted with iron and copper pigments. They introduced underglaze painting, blazing the way for the development of this form of ornamentation in Chinese ceramics.\nThe Changsha potters made a wide variety of forms and many of these were represented in the Belitung cargo. Apart from daily utensils like bowls and ewers, they also fashioned toys and scholars’ implements such as water droppers. The potters often instilled an element of fun into their wares. A fine example is the incense burner that has a cover topped with a man tussling with a lion. The man is forcing open the mouth of the beast, which creates the hole where the smoke escapes.\nTripod incense burner with man and lion. ca. 830, stoneware. Tang Shipwreck Treasure: Singapore's Maritime Collection.\nPhotograph copyright Asian Civilisations Museum.\nChangsha wares appear to have been popular in both domestic and overseas markets. Significant quantities have been excavated at the port of Yangzhou, where they must have been stored before being shipped. They have also been found in large amounts in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia.\nOther Ceramics\nIn addition to Changsha wares for the wider market, the ship ferried a selection of finer ceramics, reflecting the prevailing taste in China. Such an assortment of goods was made possible by the network of waterways (rivers and the Grand Canal) which linked northern and southern China, as well as inland cities to coastal ports. The items included high-fired white wares that represent the ceramic achievements of northern China, and green-glazed stone wares which were premier products of the south during the Tang period. During the eighth and ninth centuries, Yue celadons from Zhejiang and Hebei’s Xing white wares were regarded as symbols of beauty, elegance, and wealth. The Chinese affection for monochrome ceramics crystallised at this time and reached its height in the Song dynasty (960 – 1279).\nThe Tang cargo also contained three extremely rare blue-and-white dishes, which are among the earliest complete Chinese blue-and-white ceramics known.\nUnlike the ceramics mentioned in the previous paragraphs, the production of blue-and-white wares was short-lived during the Tang dynasty, probably because it did not match the prevailing Chinese taste. The lozenge with leafy fronds, seen on the Belitung blue-and-white dishes, is a motif that originated in eighth- or early ninth-century Iraq. The cobalt used to paint the designs may have come from the Abbasid Empire. They were made chiefly for export, and the Belitung examples may have been experimental prototypes sent for the approval of Abbasid clients.\nWhite Wares\nProbably the most valuable ceramics on the ship was a relatively small consignment of white wares. Comprising some 300 pieces, they were drawn from three or four different kilns in northern China. The finest were produced at the Xing kilns in Hebei province. Thinly potted and covered with a glossy clear glaze, they were likened to snow and silver. The exquisite Xing wares were imitated by the Ding kilns located farther north in Hebei and the Gongxian kilns in Henan province. Although connoisseurs of Tang ceramics ranked Xing wares as supreme, the products of the Xing and Ding kilns were often very similar and almost indistinguishable. Attribution was made more difficult by the poor condition of some of the finds.\nGreen-splashed Wares\nAlmost 200 pieces of white wares decorated with copper-green splashes were recovered from the wreck. Chemical analysis of retrieved shards suggests that the majority of these ceramics came from the kilns at Gongxian in Henan province. Gongxian potters probably sought to develop alternative product lines as their white wares faced serious competition from Xing ceramics. These more colourful products appealed in particular to foreign markets. Tang green-splashed wares have been found at the Abbasid city of Samarra (Iraq) and the port of Siraf (Iran), among many other sites in the Near East region.\nGreen Wares\nThe most esteemed green wares from the Yue kilns in Zhejiang province were likened to jade. Lu Yu, a tea connoisseur from the Tang dynasty, rated Yue tea bowls most highly in his Chajing (The Classic of Tea), the first monograph on tea in the world. The lustrous glaze of Yue wares was perceived to enhance the tea’s colour. Yue ceramics were thus often undecorated, emphasising the beauty of their glaze and form instead.\nOf the approximately 900 pieces of green wares found on the ship, only around 200 were from the Yue kilns. The rest were products of Guangdong, which consisted mainly of sturdy storage containers and a small selection of tableware. The figures reflect the limited output of the Yue kilns, which seem to have rather strict quality control. Just like the many ceramic wares found on board, there was an enthusiastic foreign market for green wares, as indicated by their discovery at sites as far afield as Samarra in Iraq, Siraf in Iran, and Fustat (old Cairo) in Egypt.\nPrecious Metals\nThe gold, silver, and bronze objects found in the shipwreck constituted one of the most important discoveries of Tang metalwork, and the first outside of China. Especially rare are the objects of pure gold: an octagonal cup, three shallow bowls, and three dishes. Also discovered were silver boxes of varying forms, possibly used as containers for cosmetics, incense or medicine; and a richly decorated wine flask.\nA total of 29 Chinese bronze mirrors were found in the wreck – one of the largest assemblages of Tang mirrors ever discovered. Such a large collection suggests that the mirrors were meant to be sold, and not the crew’s personal possessions. Among the mirrors was the only surviving example of a celebrated form called “Jiangxin” or “Yangxin” (Heart of the Yangzi River), which was previously recorded in texts. It was supposedly cast on board a boat moored in the Yangzi River at Yangzhou and charged with cosmological powers. Of extremely high quality, it was also presented as tribute to the imperial court.\nMany of these objects were probably made in Yangzhou, a leading centre of fine craft. It remains a mystery for whom these luxuries were intended. The gold objects might have been gifts from the Tang emperor in return for tribute presented by a foreign mission. Or they might have been used by Chinese officials to ease trade negotiations over desirable imports from abroad, such as spices, pearls and other exotic rarities. Whichever the case, these extravagant articles indicate that the masters of the Belitung ship were engaged in dealings with the elite of Tang society.\nAlthough there are still many puzzles surrounding the ship and its excavation has raised debate, the importance of this Tang shipwreck is immense. Its extensive cargo is one of the most significant assemblages of Tang artefacts found at a single site. Not only does it serve as a time capsule of ninth-century Tang China, it has also revealed the interactions between China, Southeast Asia and the Middle East, showing an already very well connected world.\nKan Shuyi is Curator (China), Asian Civilisations Museum.\nEXHIBITION INFORMATION:\nTang Shipwreck Gallery\nAs of 2018, this exhibition is permanent.\nAsian Civilisations Museum, Empress Place\nThis exhibition is organised by the Asian Civilisations Museum and the Singapore Tourism Board.

Pointing to the 19th century church bells, Pok Cheng San tells visitors that Boston bell maker Paul Revere gifted these bells to his son-in-law and first American Consul to Singapore, Joseph Balestier. The Mandarin-speaking docent then adds, “It was just a work trip, but Balestier’s father-in-law bade him final farewell!”\nThe joke cracks up some 20 Chinese-speaking visitors to the National Museum of Singapore. In Mandarin, “gifting bells” is pronounced “song zhong”, which sounds similar to the Chinese words for “seeing someone off at his funeral”.\nThis is just one instance of how the 57-year-old brings to life the Singapore story during a two-hour long tour of Singapura: 700 years, an exhibition that retells the history of this city-state. One of 60 Mandarin Guides at the National Heritage Board (NHB), Cheng San gives regular tours at the National Museum of Singapore.\nCheng San’s love for history began as a student at River Valley Government Chinese Middle School (now River Valley High School). He fondly recalls how his history teacher used to retell the past with so much gusto. While he did well enough to pursue a degree in history, his parents saved what little education funds they had for Cheng San’s eldest brother instead. “People in their generation gave priority to the first male child,” he says with resignation.\nMaking connections\nCheng San ended up putting himself through a part-time diploma course in business administration. He now works as a human resource manager at a waste wood recycling company. But, on his own time, he continued reading history books as a hobby.\nIn 2012, when he heard NHB was recruiting docents, he immediately signed up to undergo the seven-month training on Singapore’s history. Today, Cheng San is scheduler and research coordinator for NHB’s Mandarin Docents.\nIn his opinion, good docents perform, rather than reel off facts about the exhibits. This is something he learnt from attending tours during his visits to museums in China. Their docents’ masterful retelling of history had him staying on till the end of the tour despite his tired legs. It also set a benchmark for his own tours.\n“I made a promise to myself to become as good as they are,” he recalls. This is why he willingly spends months researching and building on the curator’s work for his tours, and even tailors his delivery to audiences. “It’s boring even for the musician if he performs the same piece every night,” he says.\nMore importantly, he helps audiences see connections, something he found hard to do when he used to read history books for fun. “I took in information in fragments, so I couldn’t see relationships between events when there were,” he recalls. Today, Cheng San sees not only historical connections between museum artefacts, but also has developed the confidence to find clues about the past. Stopping at the painting View of Singapore from Mount Wallich on his tour, he draws the visitors’ attention to details in the 19th century painting. Cheng San points out how Telok Ayer Market still stands today as Lau Pa Sat, and the sea it depicts has since been reclaimed to house today’s thriving business district.\nAs the people who join his Mandarin-speaking tours are often tourists from China, Cheng San makes it a point to highlight common histories between Singapore and China. One of them is opium. After the British colonial government established and profited from opium farming and trading in 19th century Singapore, he tells those on tour, many Chinese immigrants became addicted to the drug. His listeners nod their heads sympathetically, reminded of China’s Opium War and the resulting cession of Hong Kong.\nCheng San then ushers them to a section featuring prominent Chinese businessman Tan Kah Kee. He asks, “Who established the prestigious Xiamen University in Fujian?” A visitor in his 20s replies, “Chen Jiageng!”\nStudents in China, Cheng San knows, study about Tan Kah Kee, whose name in Mandarin is Chen Jiageng. But, the familiarity with Tan Kah Kee is an exception, adds Cheng San.\nOn his tours, he has encountered many tourists who are misinformed about Singapore, often through inaccurate facts they encounter online. This is another reason why he readily volunteers his weekends to give tours, offering more than the 12 sessions a year he needs to fulfil as an NHB docent. Beyond the joy of entertaining museum visitors with stories about Singapore’s past, Cheng San says being a docent gives him the opportunity to carry out important work: guiding how visitors perceive this city-state, beginning with an accurate understanding of its past.\nBy Sheere Ng", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/heritage-volunteers-pok-cheng-san/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/heritage-volunteers/09-pok-cheng-san/01-pok-cheng-san.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:17"},

Text by Kan Shuyi\nImages courtesy of Shaanxi Cultural Heritage Promotion Center and Famen Temple Museum\nBe Muse Volume 7 Issue 2 – Apr to Jun 2014\nThe Discovery\nShining their torches into the dark depths, the archaeologists were astonished to see gleaming articles of gold and silver packed into a stone chamber. It was April 3, 1987, and this was their first sight of the crypt beneath the Famen Temple pagoda, which had been built in the early 17th century. Structurally weakened by earthquake tremors and age, the pagoda had collapsed after a period of heavy rainfall on August 24, 1981. Local authorities had decided to rebuild the pagoda after its dramatic fall, leading to a full-scale excavation of the site – and one of China’s major archaeological discoveries of the twentieth century.\nFoundations of the Famen Temple Pagoda in 1987, The steps in the foreground lead to the three chambers of the crypt. The raised squares on the perimeter are the foundations of the Tang Wooden Pagoda. The circulate depression in the centre is the foundation of the Ming Stone Pagoda.\nNot one, but three chambers containing a rich variety of items were discovered in the underground complex. The subterranean structure, which included a flight of stairs and a corridor leading to the three successive rooms, measured 21.1 metres in its entire length and 2 to 2.55 metres in width. This was the large Tang pagoda crypt found to date and contained hundreds of objects, which included gold and silver utensils, precious ceramics, rare Islamic glassware, silk textiles, and one carvings. But most significant among the finds was the finger bone relic of the Buddha. In fact four finger bone relics were recovered, one in each of the three chambers and the fourth in a tiny squarish compartment hidden beneath the rear chamber.\nThis fourth relic is purported to be the genuine one, referred to in Chinese sources as the zhen shen (“true body” relic) and the ling gu (灵骨, “spirit bone”), while the other three relics found in the three main chambers are described as ying gu (影骨, “shadow bone”). Two of these ying gu were made of jade and the third of bone, and they may have served as decoys to protect the true relic during religious persecutions in the mid-ninth century.\nThe Famen Temple was one of four Buddhist sites in China reputed to house the fingerbone relic of the historical Buddha, Shakyamuni. The other three were Puguangwangsi in Sizhou, Jiangsu province; Mount Wutai in Daizhou, Shanxi province; and Wutai in Mount Zhongnan, Shaanxi province. Traces of the relics at these other locations have, however, lost over time.1\nThe partly collapsed pagoda of the Famen Temple in 1981.\nThe Famen Temple\nFamensi (法门寺), also known as Famen Temple or Famen Monastery, is situated approximately 110 km west of Xi’an in Fufeng county, Shaanxi province. Its beginnings remain obscure but its history with the Buddha’s relics is legendary. The Famen Temple was believed to be founded in the Eastern Han dynasty (25–220), when it was known as Ayuwangsi (阿育王寺 or Aśoka Temple). The relic at the site was also associated with King Aśoka (reigned 269–232 BC) of the Mauryan dynasty, who according to Buddhist tradition re-collected Buddha’s relics and re-dispersed them to 84,000 stupas. What has been determined with greater certainty, however, is that the finger bone relic was worshipped in 555. This was the first time the veneration of the Buddhist relic at the Famensi site was recorded in writing.\nThis textual evidence came from one of two one steles found within the crypt. Inscribed in 874, this one stele provides a broad overview of the history of Famen Temple. It outlines the various occasions on which the relic was worshipped, and describes in particular detail the final occasion when the relic was conveyed to the capital city in 873. During the Tang dynasty, the relic was first worshipped in 631 upon the orders of Emperor Taizong (reigned 626–649). Other Tang rulers continued with the practice and the crypt was accessed in 660, 704, 760, 790, 819, and 873. Venerating the relic was believed to invoke good fortune and protective blessings for oneself and the empire.\nOn each of these occasions, the relic was conveyed to the imperial palaces at Chang’an (and sometimes Luoyang, the secondary capital of Tang China) amid much ceremonial splendour. It incited great religious fervour among the devout masses, and extreme acts of piety such as self-immolation were also noted. New offerings were likely to have been made each time the relic was re-interred at the Famen Temple, but most of these items did not survive the suppression of Buddhism in the mid-ninth century. Thus the majority of objects from the Famen Temple crypt are dated after this period and associated with the Emperors Yizong (859–873) and Xizong (873–888), the last two Tang emperors who participated in the veneration of the relic.\nThe Secret Treasures\n340 items and sets of items were excavated from the Famen Temple crypt, a figure which excludes the thousands of coins found.2 It also does not reflect the full quantity of textiles that had been originally placed in the crypt, as conservation work on this aspect is ill ongoing. Not only is this an impressive quantity of objects recovered from a single site, the quality of these items is exquisite. Many objects are unprecedented in form and/or decoration, including several rare works featuring Esoteric Buddhist iconography, such as the reliquary casket decorated with forty-five Buddhist figures. This is the earliest known visual representation of the Diamond Realm mandala in China, one of two major realms in Esoteric Buddhism.3\nReliquary with forty-five Buddhist figures, dated 871. Gilded silver, 17 x 17 x 17cm.\nFamen Temple Museum.\nThe objects – serving both religious and secular functions – were mostly presented by members of the Tang royal household for the veneration of the Buddhist relic. They had access to some of the finest objects manufactured and, as inscriptions on several of the excavated metal wares indicate, these included products from the imperial workshops in Chang’an as well as tributes from key metal-smithing centres in the southern part of China. The boldly-ornamented, tiered incense burner and the sumptuously decorated basin represent these production areas respectively. They are also two of the large surviving examples of Tang metalwork known at present.\nIncense burner with stand, dated 869.

Noted for its many benefits, tea was enjoyed across Tang society. The royal court was no exception and tea appears to have been particularly loved by Emperor Xizong. Several of the Famen Temple tea utensils are inscribed with the characters “五哥” (wu ge or fifth brother), a reference to the monarch’s infant name, which suggests that the objects were used specifically by him.\nThe imperial connection is emphasized by the \"wu ge\" inscription on the roller and the base of the grinder.

Partly gilded silver, 13x15x28.3 cm.\nFamen Temple Museum.\nEnhancing the significance of the find is the fact that the majority of these objects were recorded in the second stone stele found in the crypt. This was essentially an inventory checklist that listed the names, quantity, and weight of objects, as well as the donors who had given them to the Famen Temple. The information gleaned from this list has enabled archaeologists and scholars to gain important insights into Tang China, such as the system of measurements that was used then. This is currently the only inventory stele that has been excavated from an archaeological site in China, making it a unique and invaluable piece of epigraphical evidence.\nThe inscribed information on the inventory stele has also been key to the identification of mi se (秘色) or “secret colour” porcelain. “Secret colour” ceramics were widely celebrated in poetry during the Tang and succeeding dynasties, when their lustrous appearance was compared to the “emerald green of a thousand peaks” and “fresh lotus leaves covered with dew”. However, the actual colour of these ceramics remained a mystery until the discovery of the Famen Temple crypt and its contents, when thirteen excavated celadon vessels were matched with the inscriptions on the stele. These precious ceramics with a bluish-green hue had been produced at the Yue kilns in northern Zhejiang province, where they were made with the finest materials and under strict firing conditions.\nCeladon Bottle, by 874. Ceramic, height 21.5 cm.\nFamen Temple Museum.\nAnother group of rare finds from the Famen Temple crypt are eighteen pieces of glassware imported from the Middle East. Of various forms and designs, this cache of treasures constitutes the largest group of early Islamic glass vessels (found in mostly intact conditions) currently known in China. Deemed an exotic luxury in Tang China, Islamic glass was valued for its beauty, strength, and transparency. Its preciousness made it suitable for making containers for housing relics, such as the bottle placed in the rear chamber of the crypt. The bottle was found with a fragmentary slip of paper inked with two lines of characters, of which only two— “true” (真) and “lotus” (莲)—remain legible. This suggests that the vessel may have contained a relic of the Buddha; the lotus is a Buddhist symbol, and the finger bone relic is referred to as the True Body on the inventory stele.\nBottle, Syrian-Palestinian region, probably 7th or 8th century glass, height 21.3cm.\nFamen Temple Museum.\nIndeed, we can only speculate about many aspects of the Famen Temple and its contents. While it has been an invaluable time capsule that has enriched our knowledge of Tang society, much remains enigmatic, awaiting further resolution by current and future scholars.\nKan Shuyi is Curator, Asian Civilisations Museum\nDiscoveries from the Famen Temple was exhibited at the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) in early 2014.

Having all moved to Singapore from China during the 1930s and '40s and sharing similar backgrounds in foundational art training in China, they were close contemporaries who were driven by a desire to develop their artistic styles and techniques to best capture their new surroundings in tropical Southeast Asia.\nThis desire led the four artists to plan a trip to Indonesia in 1952 in search of artistic inspiration. There, they travelled across the country for two months including an extended period in Bali. Having been inspired by the culture and the vibrant colours of Indonesia, the subsequent works they produced for an exhibition in 1953 displayed a clear intention to capture Southeast Asian subjects using both Western oil painting and Eastern ink painting traditions—a unique synthesis which would later come to be considered as a key characteristic of the Nanyang Style. Important works of all four artists are held in the collection of National Gallery Singapore today.

In 1928, he went to Paris where he was further exposed to art movements such as Fauvism and Post-Impressionism.

Text by Alan Chong\nImages courtesy of Shaanxi Cultural Heritage Promotion Centre\nBeMuse Volume 4 Issue 3 – Jul to Sep 2011\nThe terracotta warriors of China’s First Emperor, or Shi Huangdi, have drawn worldwide attention since their chance discovery outside Xi’an in 1974. They impress with their life-like appearance, the evident attention to detail and the fact that there are so many of them. To date in 2011, about 1,900 have been unearthed, but there may be as many as 8,000 figures all together. Investigation of the vast tomb complex of the First Emperor continues and new discoveries await. The terracotta warriors have been exhibited around the globe and have become worldwide celebrities. But they are more than just spectacle – they tell us a great deal about history and art.\nThe terracotta warriors are connected with one of the most remarkable – and controversial – figures in China’s history: the king of Qin who united China in 220 BCE and became the First Emperor. He invented for himself a new title, Huangdi, based on two words to describe mythical kings, and all emperors after him used the same title. He centralised authority and attempted to unify China by standardising her money, writing and measurements. However, after his death, he was condemned as corrupt, militaristic and despotic. He is alleged to have buried Confucian scholars alive and burned their books. And he built a grandiose tomb to himself that supposedly required the efforts of 700,000 workers.\nBeyond this historical connection, the terracotta warriors are intriguing works of art that completely changed long-held beliefs about early Chinese art. Before the discovery of the terracotta warriors, nearly nothing was known about the art of the Qin dynasty, which was one of the pivot points in Chinese history. While the terracotta army confirmed the emperor’s militaristic reputation, the figures themselves seemed to be the product of a cultured and sophisticated court. Often thought to be portraits of individual warriors, on close inspection, the figures repeat a few basic types. Details of armour, costume and footwear vary within certain patterns, and the faces seem to have individual personalities because six or eight different moulds were used; beards, moustaches, hair and other details were later added. Some soldiers were shaped to hold weapons or the reins of horses. Other figures seem to stand at attention.\nGeneral, Qin dynasty (221 - 206 BCE).\nThe warriors present us with many mysteries and we cannot be certain of their precise meaning. They look real, but can we be sure that they accurately reflect Chinese soldiers of 2,200 years ago? The terracotta figures are not documents, but works of art made to decorate the First Emperor’s tomb. They therefore had powerful symbolic value. Are they a legion of the emperor’s army or his palace guard? We might assume that the warriors were meant to defend the emperor in the afterlife, but against what?\nIt is sobering to realise that the terracotta warriors, magnificent though they are, are only one part of a vast supporting structure of the First Emperor’s tomb. The terracotta figures are divided among three pits. The largest contains more than 6,000 infantry, archers and commanders, plus fifty chariots, each drawn by four horses.\nLight infantry officer (detail), Qin dynasty (221 - 206 BCE).\nPit 2 is smaller but contains more horses: 89 chariots, with four horses apiece, 116 horses with riders and additional infantry.\nHorse (detail), Qin dynasty (221 - 206 BCE).\nThe smallest pit, Pit 3, contains a single chariot and 68 warriors. A fourth pit is empty.\nPit 3 of the First Emperor's tomb complex. Photo by Ken Cheong.\nThe emperor’s tomb is buried under a large, man-made, pyramidal hill. It is protected by mountains to the south and west, and water to the north. The terracotta warriors all face east. The tomb mound was surrounded by two walls that enclosed several buildings devoted to the rituals worshipping the deceased emperor. Surrounding the tomb were numerous pits, some containing actual human and animal remains.\nSeveral half life-size chariots were buried very near the tomb. Wooden chariots ornamented with bronze and gold fittings were found on the north side, while to the west were the two famous bronze chariots, drawn by miniature bronze horses.\nChariot (replica) from the First Emperor's tomb complex.\nA pit containing thousands of small stone plaques was discovered in 1999. Eventually, someone realised that they used to form sets of armour. Because limestone is too heavy and too fragile to have been used in battle, the armour must have played a purely symbolic role. But we do not know who was meant to wear this symbolic armour.\nStone helmet and armour, Qin dynasty (221 - 206 BCE).\nOther discoveries show that the tomb world of the First Emperor was not only devoted to the military. Workers were buried near the tomb along with horses and other animals – demonstrating that human and animal sacrifice, conducted in China for thousands of years, was still a part of imperial funerary practice. And twelve pottery officials were found huddled together in a small pit, ensuring that bureaucracy would live on with the emperor.\nAnother pit contained eleven life-size terracotta figures different from the warriors. These were bare-chested men in various animated poses. Compared to the blank expressions and stiff postures of the warriors, these acrobats are much livelier and even humorous, features that have no precedent in Chinese art. One heavily muscled figure, perhaps a weightlifter, has bulging biceps, a barrel chest and a thick belly supported by a wide belt. He must have originally held something against his body with his left arm, perhaps a pole. Together with his companions, he entertained the emperor at court.\nYet another pit housed musicians made of terracotta and birds made of bronze. Forty-six swans, geese, and cranes were neatly arranged along an artificial river of mercury. Near the water birds were fifteen musicians, which suggests that this venue was for relaxation and pleasure. Another pit contains the remains of exotic animals, perhaps a zoo to delight the emperor.\nTaken as a whole, these discoveries show that many aspects of the emperor's life were recreated in underground burials. But any interpretation of the terracotta warriors remains tentative without knowledge of the tomb itself – the underground palace that houses the emperor's coffin. No excavations have yet been conducted there, but further discoveries are sure to come.\nWe can speculate as to the meaning of the terracotta warriors. They may have been commemorative, that is, a celebration of the military power that unified China. Although the tomb was started when the First Emperor was still king of the Qin state, plans must have expanded significantly when he became emperor. The warriors undoubtedly played a protective role against evil forces (as similar figures had in earlier tombs), perhaps against the spirits of old enemies to the east. The army also appears to be a component of the emperor's worldly life made in symbolic form for the afterlife. It is very likely that the terracotta army had multiple meanings, and we should be open to new avenues of interpretation.\nThe terracotta sculptures have radically altered our understanding of early Chinese art. Despite the overwhelming historical importance of Shi Huangdi, almost nothing could be associated with his reign. Objects from the Shang and Zhou dynasties had been greatly appreciated for their abstract patterns and decorative designs especially bronze vessels. At the exhibition Terracotta Warriors: The First Emperor and His Legacy, the Asian Civilisations Museum showcased a range of goods buried in Qin state tombs before the reign of the First Emperor. These included ritual bronzes, jades and gold objects.\nThe Han Dynasty\nTiger tally, Warring States period (475 - 221 BCE), Bear, Western Han dynasty, 1st century BCE, Rooster, Western Han dynasty, 2nd century BCE, Crane, Qin dynasty (221 - 206 BCE).\nThe Qin dynasty quickly collapsed after the death of the First Emperor. After a period of civil war, Liu Bang established the Han dynasty in 202 BCE. Many of the First Emperor’s reforms were retained. The small seal script, standardised weights and measures, and revised coinage continued to be used during the Han empire. Using the Qin bureaucratic system, the Han dynasty developed a highly centralised government and successfully ruled China for four centuries.\nHan tombs, however, are very different from the First Emperor’s. It seems as though the first Han emperors, while retaining the long tradition of burying terracotta figures, wished to separate themselves as much as possible from Shi Huangdi. Early Han rulers preferred simplicity to sumptuousness, the miniature to monumentality. Compared to the life- size Qin terracotta figures, Han pottery figurines are much smaller and represent many aspects of daily life. In addition to soldiers and courtiers, Han tombs feature kitchens and domestic animals. The sacrificial pits around Emperor Jing’s mausoleum contain a great number of officials, entertainers and attendants. The faces of these figurines are softly contoured, usually with graceful facial expressions and serene smiles. The Han people’s affection for tranquillity and simplicity was based on the core concept of Daoism – the pursuit of harmony with nature.\nSoldier on horseback, Western Han dynasty, 2nd century BCE.\nKneeling woman attendant, Western Han dynasty, 2nd - 1st century BCE.\nIn the pits around Yangling, the tomb of Emperor Jing, large numbers of soldiers were found naked and armless. Originally, they had wooden arms and wore costumes made of cotton and silk. Just as the First Emperor inherited a rich tradition, so was his legacy a powerful one. Although the Western Han dynasty tried its best to set itself apart from the notorious unifier of China, it followed the same ancient traditions of burial and preparation for the afterlife. The soldiers and court officials made in terracotta for Han tombs provide a fascinating contrast to the imposing Qin terracotta warriors. The First Emperor perhaps must now be regarded as a force in art as powerful as in military might and governmental authority. The terracotta warriors and the other objects from his tomb complex continue to startle and delight us because they are magnificent works of art.\nAlan Chong was director of the Asian Civilisations Museum.", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/tales-from-the-tomb-what-the-terracotta-warriors-tell-us/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/tales-from-the-tomb-what-the-terracotta-warriors-tell-us/tales-from-the-tomb-cover.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:17"},

Choy endured torture following her arrest in 1943 by the Japanese kempeitai (military police) on suspicion of aiding the British.

As a mode of dress for Chinese women, it was popularised in Shanghai during the 1920s and '30s, when the city was an influential fashion capital. Then, the cheongsam itself was the standard dress for many Chinese women in China's cities, as well as in the cities with large Chinese communities such as Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore. In style, it is believed to have evolved from a long robe worn by Manchu women during the Qing dynasty in China.\nThe easy availability of cheongsams from Cantonese and Shanghainese tailors in Singapore contributed to the popularity of the dress here, with most working women in Singapore having at least one cheongsam in the 1950s and '60s. Many working women adopted the cheongsam as their work attire because it projected modern and progressive values that they subscribed to as modern women.\nThis is an extract from \"The Singapore Story through 60 objects\" written by Kennie Ting, Director, Asian Civilisations Museum and Peranakan Museum & Group Director of Museums, National Heritage Board.

Text by Maria Khoo Joseph\nBe Muse Volume 7 Issue 3 - Jul to Sep 2014\nFor many Peranakan Chinese of Southeast Asia, religion and ritual play a central role in their daily lives. Many ceremonies, from Chinese New Year to the annual tomb cleaning (cheng beng) festival, involve setting up altars and invoking deities and ancestors. Altars usually hold religious paraphernalia and offerings. On special occasions, textiles are draped in front.\nAltar cloths, called tok wi in Hokkien (zhuowei in Mandarin), are usually made of silk with embroidered designs and were originally imported from Southern China. Common motifs included dragons, phoenix, qilin, ruyi sceptre, swastika, and other auspicious symbols. The cloths are almost uniformly rectangular – to cover the shape of the front of a typical altar. An extra piece of fabric, also decorated, hangs as a flap over the upper section. Fragments of such hangings and altar frontals have been discovered in excavations of Tang-dynasty (618–907) monasteries near the Dunhuang Caves, in present day Gansu province, demonstrating that the tradition has been long-held.\nAltar cloth: pair of dragons\nJava, mid-20th century Cotton (drawn batik)\nGift of Matthew and Alice Yapp\nBy the early twentieth century, Peranakans on Java began using altar cloths made of local batik. These batik altar cloths maintained the form of the embroidered versions, though they adapted established Chinese symbols in imaginative renderings and introduced motifs and designs from Southeast Asian and European cultures. Most batik altar cloths are designed on a single piece of cotton cloth, with depicted, rather than actual, upper panels. It is unclear why Peranakans of Java began using batik altar cloths, but perhaps it was due in part to the already thriving batik industry on the island. Another theory could be that the tropical climate of the East Indies was more suited to textiles made of cotton than of silk. Batik altar cloths show the distinct cross-cultural identity of the Peranakan communities of the region. They are fascinating examples of a community’s adaptation to its new surroundings.\nFuneral altar cloth: crane and deer\nChina, early 20th century\nEmbroidered damask silk, cotton liner and tassels\nTHE EXHIBITION\nThe Peranakan Museum received a donation of seventy-two batik altar cloths from Matthew and Alice Yapp in 2012. The cloths were collected by their son Alvin over a period of ten years. On 11 April 2014, the museum opened the exhibition Auspicious Designs: Batik for Peranakan Altars, which featured several highlights from the collection. The exhibition was divided into five sections over two floors of the museum's special exhibition gallery.\nThe first section was a contextual display featuring a deity altar and a set of furnishings that might be found in a typical Peranakan home. An altar cloth was draped over the front of the altar table, embroidered hangings adorn the doorways, and chairs flanking the altar were also covered in embroideries. This display emphasised the importance of textiles in demarcating sacred space during special occasions.\nTraditional altar setup\nThe second section focused on the embroidered silk altar cloths made in China. These cloths were imported into Southeast Asia and used by Peranakans. An example on display was a full gold thread altar cloth depicting the Three Star Gods that once belonged to the Chee family, one of the oldest families from Malacca. This section showed examples of cloths that were forerunners to the batik versions produced later in Java.\nAltar cloth: three figures\nChina, early or mid-20th century\nSilk with gold embroidery\nThe third and fourth sections of the exhibition examined the stylistic diversity found in the designs on batik altar cloths. Batik cloths in these two sections are decorated with designs that mix Chinese, Southeast Asian, and European influences.\nOne of the cloths prominently displayed the coat of arms of the Dutch East Indies at the centre, with Chinese cloud collar motifs at the sides. A selection of Chinese objects, from what are known as the Hundred Antiques, decorated the upper panel. This cloth is possibly one of the oldest batik altar cloths in the museum's collection: it was made using natural dyes.\nAltar cloth: Dutch East Indies coat of arms\nJava, early 20th century\nCotton (drawn batik), 102.8 x 103.8 cem\nGift of Matthew and Alice Yapp\nAnother cloth showed the influence of designs popular on batik sarongs. The blue and white cloth with the oral bouquet motif (called buketan in batik terminology) – a sarong design that was made popular by Dutch-Eurasian batik maker Eliza Van Zuylen – is an example of this. Another altar cloth in this section worth highlighting was the only cloth in the collection that is decorated with Roman letters – Chinese characters are much more common. The letters appear to spell the surnames “Hoe” (or “Koe”) and “Sioe”, if read from the centre along the border. The middle line reads “hong” and “leng”. In Hokkien, hong is phoenix and leng means dragon; both are depicted on this cloth. The creatures are often used as symbols of a bridal couple, which suggests this cloth may have been used in a wedding.\nAltar cloth: phoenixes, dragons, and letters\nJava, mid-20th century\nCotton (drawn batik)\nGift of Matthew and Alice Yapp\nAltar cloths could also be a means of declaring political affiliation: a cloth from Yogyakarta shows human figures waving the flag of Nationalist China.\nAltar cloth: figures with flag of the Republic of China\nJava, Yogyakarta, mid-20th century\nCotton (drawn batik), 86 x 134.5 cm\nStamped: Batikkeru Tjie Tjing Ing, Dfogja\nGift of Matthew and Alice Yapp\nAnother aspect of batik altar cloths highlighted in the exhibition was the varied interpretations of common Chinese symbols. Batik cloths featuring dragons and qilins, for example, are used to show the physical differences between the two creatures. Other objects featuring these two creatures from the collections of the Asian Civilisations Museum and the Peranakan Museum were displayed alongside these cloths, so that viewers could discuss similarities, and their possible sources.\nOne interesting comparison worth mentioning was a Balinese palanquin with nagas – a group of serpent deities – depicted on its sides, juxtaposed with a batik altar cloth that shows elongated dragons that more closely resemble the naga than the typical coiled or front-facing Chinese dragons found on embroidered altar cloths.\nThe fifth and last section provided visitors with the opportunity to learn more about the rituals per- formed by Peranakans, and how different altar cloths were used for different occasions. Cloths used during Chinese New Year and other celebratory events, for example, were coloured in strong auspicious reds and generally bright hues. For funerals, altar cloths with more sombre tones were selected.\nThese were colours often associated with mourning in the Peranakan world – blues, purples, and greens. An example of this on display was a dark blue cloth from Singapore, which features crane and deer motifs – symbolic of longevity – as well as the cicada, a symbol of immortality.\nAs with the diverse designs found on them, batik altar cloths are distinctive examples of the cross- cultural interaction inherent in the hybrid identities of the Peranakans.

This creature was more commonly made in a different medium—nephrite. The worm is depicted here in its caterpillar state, in a stylised and stick-like manner, resulting from the grooves the artist chose to represent the segmented body. The worship of the silkworm spirit can be traced to the Shang period (circa 1600-1027 BCE), when it was also common to make human sacrifices during the silkworm ceremony. This spirit is associated with the domestication of the silkworm, and, hence, the science of silk-rearing and silk-reeling which was considered as primordial an activity as rice-planting. Eventually, during the 3rd century CE, the spirit of silkworm became personified the form of Empress Xiling, the wife of the Yellow Emperor. She was considered China’s first sericulturist, while her husband is China’s first agriculturist. These two activities symbolise the roots of Chinese civilisation. Subsequent rulers of China took the roles of the First Couple, and, as part of their duty as rulers, personally observed and carried out those early agricultural and sericultural rites. By then, the spirit of silkworm was worshipped in a special ceremony officiated by the Empress each year during the second half of the third lunar month, with offerings of mulberry leaves and woven silk at a special altar set up in the silkworm temple or palace.", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/Collection-Landing/listing/1070736", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/CollectionImages/1070736.jpg", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:18"},

Location\nHistoric Site Markers sksks\nBeside Anderson Bridge, on the grounds of the Asian Civilisations Museum\nGet Directions\nDeng Xiaoping (1904-1997)\nOriginally known as Deng Xiansheng and his school name Deng Xixian, Deng Xiaoping was born on 22 August 1904 in Guang'an County, Sichuan Province. In 1920, Deng left for studies in France. His six-year stay in France proved to be a turning point in his life. He met Zhou Enlai and other founders of the Communist Youth League in Europe, and joined the League in 1923 and the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 1924.\nIn early 1926, Deng left Paris for Moscow to study at Sun Yat-Sen University. Deng returned to China in the Spring of 1927. He played an instrumental role in the revolutionary struggle led by the CPC. After the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, Deng held a number of important leadership positions and became the General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee in 1956. Deng's career suffered a setback during the ten years of the \"cultural revolution\". After the end of the \"cultural revolution\", he returned to work and eventually became the Vice Chairman of the CPC Central Committee in 1977 and Chairman of the CPC Central Military Commission in 1981. In 1978, Deng launched the reform and opening-op policy which paved the way for China's rapid growth and development in the following decades. Deng visited Singapore in the same year\nReforms\nDeng was a staunch communist and a great patriot who aspired to achieve China's rejuvenation. On the domestic front, he implemented bold reforms. Internationally, he took steps to gradually open China up to the world. Deng's economic and administrative reforms were marked by pragmatism, and served the need for social order and a corrupt-free government. His pragmatic approach towards reforms is best captured in his own words, \"It does not matter if it is a yellow cat or a black cat as long as it catches mice\". He introduced the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics. All forms of economic controls were relaxed and the first group of Special Economic Zones (Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou and Xiamen) was initiated. These economic initiatives resulted in exponential growth for China. Internationally, Deng started China's closer ties with the world. Relations with the United States were normalised on 1 January 1979.\nSingapore-China Relationship\nIn November 1978, Deng paid his first and only official visit to Singapore. He was impressed with what he saw and showed a particular interest in the benefits of foreign investments for Singapore. At the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee of the CPC in 1978, Deng initiated the dual policies of economic reform and openness to the world. His visit in Singapore also laid the foundation for the strong ties that exist between the two countries today, even though diplomatic relations was established only on 3 October 1998. Following Deng's famous Southern Tour in 1992, when he commented on Singapore's good social order and management, many Chinese officials were sent to Singapore for training. Over the years, the bilateral relationship had been further deepened through the frequent exchange of high-level visits, strong economic cooperation, and people-to-people exchanges. Deng passed away on 19 February 1997 at the age of 93. He is best remembered as one of the most successful statesmen of modern China, and the chief architect who transformed China into an economic giant.\nDeng Xiao Ping", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/places/places-landing/Places/historic-sites/deng-xiaoping", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/historic-sites/018-deng-xiao-ping/018-deng-xiao-ping.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:20"},

Objects carry powerful messages about their makers, and this chopping tool is the beginning of a relationship between humans and the things they create which is both a love affair and a dependency. Text by Szan Tan\nMuseSG Volume 9 Issue 1 – Jan to Mar 2016\n“[R]ight from the beginning, we – unlike other animals – have felt the urge to make things more sophisticated than they need to be. Objects carry powerful messages about their makers, and this chopping tool is the beginning of a relationship between humans and the things they create which is both a love affair and a dependency.”\n- Neil MacGregor, former Director of British Museum, in History of the World in 100 Objects\nObjects embody ideas and concerns common to mankind. From creating hand tools to dishes to metal alloys/ware, mankind created objects to meet evolving needs over time. As such, these objects tie in strongly with the development of human civilisation. Objects reflect our close relationships with our physical environment and the natural and animal world, and also capture the relationship we have with the spiritual world. Throughout history, humanity’s complex interconnection with each other has also been further demonstrated through objects.\nFrom December 5, 2015 to May 29, 2016, Treasures of the World from the British Museum at the National Museum of Singapore brought together many objects that illustrate the fascinating relationship we have with the objects we create and possess.\nStone Hand Axe, about 800,000 years old. Lower Palaeolithic. Quartzite. Tanzania.\nRu Dish with Emperor’s Inscription, AD 1086 to 1125. Stoneware with Celadon Glaze. China.\nHand Tools\nA 800,000-year-old stone handaxe, discovered in the Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania by the archaeologist Louis Leakey, is much like the chopping tool mentioned by Neil Macgregor, former Director of British Museum. It represents the beginning of mankind’s story, and our relationship with the objects we create. The making of the tools like the handaxe tells of man’s resourcefulness and ability to harness the raw materials from his physical environment.\nMan may know to utilise raw materials for survival and protection, but great skill and dexterity are required to transform a lump of stone into a tool, and to craft it exquisitely too. Based on many of the handaxes found in the Olduvai Gorge, it is speculated that early humans went beyond function and created them as art pieces and status symbols. The handaxes were simply too large and beautifully crafted to function as practical tools for everyday use.\nBlue-and-white Porcelain Dish, AD 1403 to 1424. Porcelain with Underglaze Cobalt-Blue Decoration. China.\nSeated Figure of the Goddess Bastet, Late period Egypt, 664 to 302 BC. Bronze.\nPrized Pottery\nThe transformation of clay into pottery, stoneware and porcelain through ring marks another development in man’s relationship with his environment. A Ru dish and blue-and-white porcelain dish in the exhibition are splendid results of man’s search for the finest materials, his exploitation of them, and the success of his many experiments in creating ne and delicate objects reserved only for the imperial family.\nAdmired for their thin bodies, duck-egg blue glaze and delicate crack lines, Ru wares were only produced briefly for a period of about 30 years, from AD 1086 to 1127. Today, there are only 70 extant pieces, mainly in museum collections.\nAppreciated and sought all over the world later in history were Chinese porcelains with under-glazed blue decoration, commonly known as “blue and white” porcelain. These Chinese porcelains made from a combination of porcelain stone and kaolin, which was then found only in China, were very much adored for their highly vitrified, pure and translucent bodies. Produced mainly in Jingdezhen in southern China’s Jiangxi province, many of these wares were exported to the Near and Middle East and other countries in Asia from the fifteenth century onwards. Great quantities of these Chinese export porcelains eventually found their way to Europe and were all the rage there in the seventeenth to eighteenth century.\nRitual Wine Vessel, 500 BC. Bronze. China.\nProcessional Cross, AD 1730 to 1755. Bronze and Gold. Ethiopia.\nMetalwork and Social Status\nBesides ceramics, the course of metal technology development also demonstrates our abilities in transforming our natural resources to make objects that will protect, serve and bolster our social positions. Man created bronze using copper and combining it with other metals such as zinc and lead. Through inventive techniques – such as mould casting, lost wax technique, repoussé and chasing – bronze figurines, weapons, armours, shields, vessels and ceremonial implements were formed and decorated in various cultures.\nExamples of these bronze objects could be found in the Treasures of the World from British Museum exhibition. They range from the figure of the Egyptian goddess Bastet in the form of a cat (dating to the Late period of Egypt from 664 to 302 BC), an Eastern Zhou wine vessel from the Houma Foundry in China, a shield from North Wales dated to the Late Bronze Age (around 1200 to 1000 BC), to a processional cross from Gondar, Ethiopia (dated AD 1730 to 1755).\nHarmensz van Rijn, Rembrandt. The Three Crosses, AD 1653. Dry Point Etching.\nStatue of Ganesha, around AD 1200. Sandstone. India.\nSpiritual Connections\nIn negotiating our harsh environment and fighting for survival with other species, man turned to the spiritual world for protection. Spirits were appeased and propitiated; protection was sought from gods, goddesses and ancestors. The teachings of great beings were studied and revered, and religious systems and beliefs were created.\nIn some societies, certain animals were considered sacred and venerated as deities which were both feared and loved. An obsession with afterlife arose in certain cultures, where elaborate ceremonies and belief systems were created to ensure a smooth transition to the netherworld and/or to achieve everlasting life after death. Humanity’s relationship with the spiritual realm can be seen in many objects, ranging from the mummies of ancient Egypt, the sculpted or cast figures of Buddhas in Asia and Southeast Asia, to the exaltation of Christ or the Virgin Mary in prints and votive plaques.\nA masterpiece of this communion with the spiritual realm can be found in the work of Rembrandt (Harmensz van Rijn, 1606 to 1668), entitled The Three Crosses and dated AD 1653. Here, the scene of Christ’s crucifixion is highly dramatised through the clever use of light and shade. The frail body of Jesus is situated in the centre, and all light and focus are on him and his death. Only upon closer study can one see the confusion and suffering surrounding Jesus. Prints such as this were a means of bringing Biblical stories vividly to life and to aid in private prayers. Other striking examples from the exhibition that tell the story of man’s spiritual connections include a Gandanran Buddha, a statue of Ganesha from Orissa, India and a Tang dynasty silk painting of the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra, found in the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang.\nPainting of the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra, Tang Dynasty (around AD 750 to 850). Ink and Colours on Silk.\nA Tablet from King Ashurbanipal’s Library, 700 to 600 BC. Clay. Northern Iraq.\nCommunication\nThrough objects, we can also trace man’s communication and complex relationships with each other. With the invention of writing, information could be passed down as records could be kept. One of the earliest forms of writing was in the form of a cuneiform (wedge-shaped) script inscribed on clay or stone tablets from Mesopotamia.\nThe relationship of man with each other were outlined, defined and reinforced through writing. Social hierarchies and political legitimacies were thus strengthened too.\nKnowledge was also passed down via written word. Representative of this are insights into common ailments and their remedies, found on the tablets from King Ashurbanipal’s library in Nineveh, northern Iraq. A clay tablet from his collection, dated 700 to 600 BC, details stomach disorders and prescribes remedies for each. It is part of a therapeutic series entitled “If a man suffers from a phlegmy cough, and it turns into intestinal disease”.\nObjects and Symbolism\nThrough the ages, man has sought to define his place in society through the use of symbols, the enactment of rituals, or performance of ceremonies. Objects carved with powerful symbols, sometimes passed down for generations, acquired extra blessings and power. An Asmat warrior would have carried a war shield to emphasise his strength and to intimidate his enemies. Personal adornments made from rare, precious materials and attached with powerful symbols were worn by man to define his position and to set him apart from other men. Netsuke were intricately carved toggles, worn by Japanese men from town during the Edo period. They were miniature and portable art pieces which were an essential part of the costume of a Japanese townsman, defining his status and wealth.\nWar Shield, early 1900s.

Although it was planned for more than a decade earlier, works on the market started only in 1927. The land on which the market was built had once been a Chinese burial ground which was cleared in 1907. It was only in 1925 that the road next to the future market was laid and named Maxwell Road. It was from then that the intended edifice was called Maxwell Road Market. After the construction works of the main structure had been completed in mid-1928, a tender was then called for the installation of the market’s stalls. The market opened for business in 1929.\nMaxwell Road Food Centre, 1980s\nCourtesy of National Archives of Singapore\nHowever, most of street hawkers intended to be relocated into the new market chose to remain outside the surrounding streets around the market where they did not have to pay any rental. This made situation difficult for those who had taken stalls within the market as they were unable to make any profit with keen competition from the itinerant street hawkers. By late 1929, the market became a “white elephant”. In response, cooked food stalls and eating tables were added a year later. By the late 1930s, the market became a site where Teochew theatrical performances were staged during the annual Hungry Ghost Festivals.\nThe market remained open during the Japanese Occupation. Interestingly, in an attempt to draw hawkers to the market, the Japanese authorities reduced the rental charges on market stalls and controlled all items on sale.  After World War II, Maxwell Road Market became one of the sites where the government had a “Family Restaurant” that sold cheap meals to thousands of poor and displaced. The Maxwell Market restaurant would be the first of a chain of restaurants selling meals at eight cents that the Singapore Social Welfare Department started across Town from December 1946. It also included a children feeding centre that provided free meals for two to six year olds.\nThe market underwent several significant changes in the post-war years. In January 1949, the municipality passed a rule that municipal markets could only sell perishable goods. All others vendors, like “bread and provision sellers and money changers”, had to move out by April that year. Maxwell Road Market had two money changers at this time. Then, in 1951, when high food prices became a problem in Singapore, many vendors at Maxwell Road Market were found overcharging. The government implemented measures to control prices at markets facing this problem. In December 1951, the government appointed a firm, Madju Trading Company, to retail beef to markets at 20% below market prices. Maxwell Road Market was among the first three chosen market for this initiative.\nGoing into the 1960s, although there were ample spaces in 42 public markets, tens of thousands of street hawkers had still decided no remain on the streets. The government markets were at most, only 80% occupied. At Maxwell Road Market, only half the stalls had been taken up. Things only changed in the 1970s, following urban renewal processes in Town. In 1972, when the Telok Ayer Market underwent renovation to be converted into a food centre, 73 of its market produce stalls were relocated to Maxwell Road Market. While on one hand, this became the first time the market had been almost fully occupied, the transference of the market produce vendors to Maxwell Road Market also delayed its own journey towards becoming a food centre.\nThe first step towards becoming a food centre took place in 1986, when 70 street food hawkers who had been operating under a temporary zinc-and-roof structure along the back lanes around China Square were moved to Maxwell Road Market. They had been operating in the China Street area with makeshift open-aired stalls before being moved to China Square in 1979. Interestingly, these hawkers, the last of the back lane hawkers, had originated from the defunct private Erna Market (1946-48) in Chinatown. At Maxwell Road, they joined 22 other cooked food hawkers. Hence, Maxwell Road Market had been turned into a huge food centre by this time, albeit unplanned. Unfortunately, a couple of years later, all of them had to be moved again when Maxwell itself underwent its own major renovation and transformation.\nIn 1987, Maxwell Road Market was officially turned into a food centre. Since then, it has become a popular place for traditional Chinese foods.", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/Hawker-Centres/Maxwell-Road-Food-Centre", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/hawker-centres/maxwell-food-centre-resized.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:21"},

Introduction\nMengenai skim Galeri Warisan Sudut Jalan\nSkim Galeri Warisan Sudut Jalan adalah usaha kolaborasi antara muzium NHB, institusi warisan dan galeri komuniti serta pemilik kedai tempatan di kawasan masing-masing untuk memperkukuhkan perkongsian dengan komuniti dan meningkatkan kesedaran dan memupuk penghargaan yang lebih mendalam terhadap warisan di ruang sehari-hari.\nSkim ini membolehkan NHB bekerjasama dengan pemilik kedai tempatan dengan sejarah sekurang-kurangnya 30 tahun di kawasan terpilih untuk bersama-sama membuat \"muzium mini\" yang memaparkan sejarah dan warisan perniagaan dan perdagangan masing-masing. Galeri yang terletak di kedai-kedai ini akan memaparkan dokumen sejarah, gambar dan artefak yang menceritakan kisah- kisah mereka.\nSelain menyediakan dana, sokongan kuratorial dan bantuan dalam membuat pameran, NHB juga akan bekerjasama dengan pemilik kedai tempatan untuk mengembangkan program seperti ceramah, lawatan dan bengkel, dan memberi peluang untuk mengambil bahagian dalam acara penting NHB seperti Pesta Warisan Singapura dan Pesta Budaya oleh institusi warisan masing-masing di kawasan mereka.\nStreet Corner Heritage Galleries: Chinatown\nதெருமுனை மரபுடைமைக் காட்சிக்கூடம்: சைனாடவுன்\n老店铺文化站: 牛车水\nPenjagaan Perubatan untuk Semua Manusia: Eu Yan Sang\nKisah Eu Yan Sang bermula pada tahun 1873 apabila Eu Kong, seorang pendatang dari Guangdong, China, tiba di Perak, Tanah Melayu.  Beliau membuat pemerhatian bahawa golongan pekerja lombong bijih timah sering menggunakan candu untuk mengurangkan kesakitan mereka.\nDengan keyakinan bahawa perubatan tradisional Cina boleh memberikan pengurusan kesakitan dan rawatan penyakit yang lebih baik, Eu membuka dewan perubatan di Gopeng pada tahun 1879, dengan menamakannya sebagai \"Yan Sang\", yang bermaksud \"menjaga semua manusia\" dalam bahasa Kantonis.\nApabila Eu Kong meninggal dunia, anak lelakinya, Eu Tong Sen, mengambil alih perniagaan pada usia 21 tahun. Berbekalkan kepintaran berniaga yang mendalam, Tong Sen mengembangkan perniagaan keluarganya daripada perubatan tradisional kepada perlombongan bijih timah, perladangan getah dan pembangunan hartanah. Berazam untuk membebaskan pelombong bijih timah daripada ketagihan candu mereka, beliau menubuhkan dewan perubatan berhampiran lombong bijih timahnya untuk menyediakan rawatan perubatan kepada golongan pelombong.\nMenjelang tahun 1910-an, perniagaan perubatan tradisional Cina keluarga itu, yang dijenamakan semula sebagai \"Eu Yan Sang\", telah berkembang ke Singapura, Hong Kong dan selatan China. Dewan perubatan Eu Yan Sang pertama di Singapura dibuka di alamat 265-271 South Bridge Road pada tahun 1910. Selain menyediakan penjagaan kesihatan dan bekalan perubatan dengan harga yang berpatutan, dewan perubatan Eu Yan Sang juga menyediakan perkhidmatan pengiriman wang dan pembantu kedainya akan membantu para pendatang yang buta huruf membaca dan menulis surat.\nHari ini, Eu Yan Sang meneruskan misi pengasasnya untuk menjaga semua manusia melalui perubatan tradisional, dan mengendalikan lebih 200 cawangan dan klinik di rantau ini.\nPisau ini telah digunakan pada masa lalu oleh pakar herba Eu Yan Sang untuk menghiris dan memotong herba yang digunakan dalam preskripsi.\nRasa Tradisional Bak Kwa: Lim Chee Guan\nTerkenal dengan orang ramai beratur panjang semasa musim perayaan, Lim Chee Guan ditubuhkan oleh Lim Kay Eng yang tiba dari Fujian, China pada tahun 1920-an. Dengan tidak menuruti hasrat ibu bapanya untuk menjadi seorang doktor, Lim bekerja keras di ladang dan kedai sebelum menyimpan wang yang cukup untuk memulakan perniagaan kereta sorong menjual bak kwa (hirisan daging barbeku) di sepanjang Chin Chew Road pada tahun 1938.\nLim menamakan perniagaan itu \"Chee Guan\" yang diterjemahkan sebagai \"cita-cita dan kewibawaan\" dalam bahasa Mandarin. Beliau membuat bak kwa menggunakan resipi neneknya dan mengubah suai perapan daging itu mengikut cita rasa tempatan. Lim turut berujikaji dalam proses penyediaan, seperti mengeringkan daging di bawah sinar matahari dan membakarnya di atas arang untuk memberikan rasa berasap yang tersendiri.\nPada tahun 1956, Lim berpindah ke rumah kedai yang disewa di sepanjang New Bridge Road di mana separuh daripada kedai itu digunakan untuk pengeluaran bak kwa dan yang separuh lagi untuk jualan runcit. Lim dan keluarganya kemudian menghabiskan sebahagian besar masa lapang mereka di kedai itu dan tradisi keluarga yang membantu dalam perniagaan ini masih diamalkan oleh generasi kedua dan ketiga keluarga Lim, yang menjalankan perniagaan itu sekarang.\nSehingga hari ini, jenama Lim Chee Guan berada dekat di hati para pelanggan lamanya, yang ramai daripada mereka tidak kisah beratur panjang malah menganggap beratur untuk membeli bak kwa di kedai itu sebagai tradisi Tahun Baru Cina.\nSepasang penyepit ini digunakan untuk membalik-balikkan hirisan daging semasa proses barbeku kerana ia lebih mudah digunakan berbanding penyepit kayu yang digunakan pada zaman dahulu.\nDaripada Barang Kemas Perak kepada Barang Kemas Peranakan: Tukang Emas Kim Poh Hong\nSelama lebih 80 tahun, Tukang Emas Kim Poh Hong telah membuat dan menjual barang kemas kepada generasi demi generasi pelanggan. Perniagaan ini diasaskan di 58 China Street pada tahun 1938 oleh Tan Eng Geok, seorang tukang perak yang datang ke Singapura dari Kinmen, China.\nSemasa tahun awalnya, Kim Poh Hong menjual barang kemas perak daripada pemborong tempatan, serta barangan buatan tangan oleh Tan. Para pelanggannya, yang kebanyakannya masyarakat Hokkien, akan sering datang ke kedai itu untuk membeli barangan istimewa seperti pemegang azimat perak untuk bayi baru lahir dan barang kemas pengebumian untuk si mati. Kedai itu juga menjual barang kemas emas, terutamanya kepingan emas kemerah-merahan yang menjadi pilihan pelanggan Hokkien.\nPada tahun 1943, Tan menubuhkan kedai emas Poh Huat di North Bridge Road bersama rakan-rakan dan menjelang 1950-an, kedua-dua kedai itu telah terkenal dengan mutu kerja dan barang kemas yang dibuat khas. Poh Huat lebih kerap dikunjungi pelanggan Melayu, India dan Nyonya berdasarkan komposisi masyarakat di kawasan itu.\nPada tahun 1971, keluarga Tan membeli Poh Huat apabila para pengasasnya bersara, dan kemudian menggabungkannya dengan Kim Poh Hong. Apabila China Street menjalani pembangunan semula pada tahun 1990-an, Kim Poh Hong berpindah dan akhirnya menetap di Pickering Street pada tahun 2002.\nHari ini, Kim Poh Hong dikendalikan oleh generasi ketiga keluarga Tan dan terkenal dalam bentuk barang kemas enamel dan Peranakan.\nBaucar hadiah perkahwinan yang dikeluarkan pada tahun 1950-an oleh Kim Poh Hong ini biasanya dibeli oleh ahli keluarga sebagai hadiah kepada pengantin baru.\nMasakan Kantonis untuk Selera Tempatan: Restoran Spring Court\nSalah satu restoran tertua di Singapura, Spring Court telah ditubuhkan di Great World Amusement Park pada tahun 1929 oleh Ho Loke Yee, bekas pemandu lori yang bertukar menjadi pengusaha restoran.\nPada asalnya dinamakan “Wing Choon Yuen” (“menyanyi di taman musim bunga” dalam bahasa Kantonis), restoran ini terkenal dengan hidangan Kantonis tempatan yang menggabungkan bahan-bahan daripada masakan Melayu, India, Hokkien dan Teochew, seperti cili dan serbuk kari, serta menampilkan perisa yang lebih kuat berbanding masakan tradisional Kantonis.\nSepanjang tahun 1930-an hingga 1960-an, Wing Choon Yuen adalah tempat di mana golongan elit, orang kenamaan, persatuan dan pengantin baru berduyun-duyun datang untuk menganjurkan majlis perayaan. Dengan kapasiti 100 meja, restoran itu sering menganjurkan tiga atau empat jamuan perkahwinan dalam satu malam. Malah, perniagaan begitu rancak sehingga Ho sering terpaksa tidur di restoran di atas katil yang diperbuat daripada meja makan.\nWalau bagaimanapun, menjelang tahun 1970-an, perniagaan merosot apabila bilangan pengunjung ke Great World semakin berkurangan. Wing Choon Yuen kemudian berpindah ke New Bridge Road pada tahun 1978, memberi nama baru, “Spring Court\", sambil mengekalkan nama Cinanya, sebelum menduduki Upper Cross Street pada tahun 2004.\nBagi kebanyakan keluarga Cina Singapura, menyambut Tahun Baru Cina di Spring Court telah menjadi tradisi tahunan. Hari ini, restoran itu dikendalikan oleh generasi ketiga keluarga Ho yang kekal komited untuk memelihara warisan makanan Cina tempatan dan menawarkan tafsiran masakan Kantonis Singapura kepada generasi muda.\nGambar ini menunjukkan jamuan perkahwinan yang diadakan di Wing Choon Yuen semasa ia terletak di Great World Amusement Park, dan dianggap sebagai tempat yang unggul untuk mengadakan majlis perkahwinan.\nDaripada Kedai Teh Tradisional kepada Pastri Lazat: Tong Heng\nDiiktiraf hari ini kerana tart telurnya yang berbentuk berlian, Tong Heng bermula sebagai perniagaan pra-perang yang dikenali sebagai Huang Hou Teahouse.\nPengasasnya, Fong Chee Heng, yang tiba pada tahun 1910-an dari Guangdong, China, bermula sebagai penjaja jalanan yang menjaja minuman di pelbagai kedai teh. Dengan wang simpanan terkumpul selama bertahun-tahun, Fong membeli kedai teh di Smith Street pada tahun 1934, yang kemudian dinamakan semula sebagai \"Tong Heng\".\nKedai teh seperti Tong Heng merupakan asas budaya Kantonis di Chinatown di mana para pelanggannya akan bertemu  untuk minum teh, menikmati kuih-muih dan bersembang. Terletak di seberang teater opera Lai Chun Yuen, Tong Heng juga merupakan tempat peminat membeli makanan manis untuk bintang kegemaran mereka.\nSelepas Perang Dunia Kedua apabila banyak kedai teh Chinatown berubah menjadi rumah makan, Tong Heng bertahan dengan membuat kuih-muih. Pada tahun 1960-an, keluarga itu memasang perabot yang memaparkan tart telur yang dibakar dalam pelbagai bentuk untuk menarik lebih ramai pelanggan. Strategi ini ternyata sangat berjaya, dan Tong Heng menjadi terkenal sebagai kedai konfeksi yang menawarkan tart telur dan pastri perkahwinan tradisional Kantonis.\nTong Heng terpaksa meninggalkan pekarangannya di Smith Street pada 1980-an kerana pembangunan semula kawasan itu dan berpindah ke lokasinya sekarang ini, di South Bridge Road. Hari ini, Tong Heng dikendalikan oleh keturunan generasi keempat dan terus kekal sebagai ikon Chinatown.\nKotak hadiah yang diperbuat khas ini digunakan untuk memuatkan barang kemas perkahwinan dan dihantar sebagai sebahagian daripada pakej apabila pelanggan menempah kuih-muih perkahwinan.\nDaging Barbeku yang Cantik dan Beraroma: Bee Cheng Hiang\nBee Cheng Hiang bermula pada tahun 1930-an sebagai gerai tepi jalan yang menjual bak kwa (hirisan daging barbeku) berhampiran bekas Majestic Theatre di Chinatown. Perniagaan ini diasaskan oleh Teo Swee Ee, yang kemudian membuka kedai pertamanya di Rochor Road.\nKeluarga itu menamakan perniagaan tersebut \"Bee Cheng Hiang\" dan setiap huruf Cina dalam namanya terdiri daripada sembilan strok untuk menandakan umur panjang dalam budaya Cina. Ia juga melambangkan pengalaman Bee Cheng Hiang, di mana bak kwa disebut-sebut sebagai \"makanan beraroma yang cantik\".\nTeo adalah seorang ahli perniagaan yang bijak dengan naluri pemasaran yang kuat. Dari tahun 1950-an, Bee Cheng Hiang, ketika itu dieja sebagai \"Bee Chun Heng\", kerap mengeluarkan iklan, menaja program radio dan mengambil bahagian dalam pameran perdagangan.\nMenjelang tahun 1970-an, Bee Cheng Hiang telah berkembang dan menubuhkan beberapa cawangan di kawasan bandar. Cawangan di New Bridge Road dengan cepat menjadi ikon di Chinatown di mana orang ramai akan beratur panjang di sekeliling blok semasa musim perayaan.\nWalaupun Bee Cheng Hiang telah berkembang menjadi sebuah syarikat berbilang negara, ia terus menggunakan kaedah pengeluaran tradisional seberapa boleh, seperti menggunakan tangan untuk meletakkan hirisan daging pada dulang buluh. Penekanan pada tradisi inilah yang menjelaskan mengapa pelanggan lama kembali lagi – untuk menikmati bak kwa yang terus mengekalkan rasa yang mereka nikmati sejak kecil lagi.\nResit ini dikeluarkan pada tahun 1972 oleh pemerintah Singapura bagi permohonan lesen makanan Bee Cheng Hiang untuk mengendalikan cawangan di New Bridge Road.\nIkon Teh Bermutu: Pek Sin Choon\nSalah satu perniagaan teh tertua di Singapura, Pek Sin Choon, diasaskan pada tahun 1925 oleh Bai-Zhuang Dan Niang dan anaknya, Pek Kim Aw.\nBai-Zhuang berpindah ke Singapura pada tahun 1910 dari Anxi, China selepas kematian bapa Pek supaya Pek boleh menjadi perantis di kedai teh bapa saudaranya di sini dan belajar tentang perdagangan. Pek meninggalkan kedai bapa saudaranya selepas mendapat sedikit pengalaman untuk bekerja di Indonesia sebagai buruh, sebelum kembali ke Singapura untuk membuka perniagaan tehnya sendiri.\nUntuk membina rangkaian pelanggannya sendiri, Pek akan membawa teh di atas palang bahu dari pintu ke pintu, menjualnya kepada peniaga dan penduduk di kawasan bandar. Menjelang 1925, Pek mempunyai wang simpanan yang cukup untuk menubuhkan kedainya sendiri di George Street. Beliau memilih kerbau sebagai maskot jenama tersebut kerana beliau digelar \"Kepala Kerbau\" oleh rakan-rakannya kerana sikapnya yang keras kepala. Lama-kelamaan Pek Sin Choon membina reputasi bagi campuran teh bermutunya.\nMemandangkan teh bermutu menjadi ciri istimewa Pek Sin Choon, Pek menerapkan budaya di mana setiap ahli keluarga dan kakitangan mesti memperoleh ilmu mendalam mengenai penyediaan dan pembuatan teh.\nDikendalikan oleh generasi keempat sekarang ini, Pek Sin Choon terus dikenali sebagai pemborong dan peruncit terkemuka teh Cina premium, dan menjadi buruan pelanggan yang mencari adunan teh yang ditempah.\nIni ialah gambar pengasas Pek Kim Aw, diambil pada tahun 1960-an, dengan set teh yang digunakan untuk merasa minum teh.\nNama Yang Dikenali Umum untuk Emas Bermutu: Tukang Emas Tin Sing\nDitubuhkan pada tahun 1937 oleh keluarga Wong, Wan dan Chow, Tin Sing ialah kedai emas pra-perang terakhir yang terletak di sepanjang South Bridge Road.\nSehingga tahun 1970-an, emas dianggap sebagai wadah simpanan tradisional dan tukang emas seperti Tin Sing sering melihat pelanggan beratur untuk membeli emas pada hari gaji. Tin Sing amat popular kerana ia menjamin pembelian balik barang kemasnya sedang tidak ramai tukang emas menawarkan jaminan sedemikian.\nTerkenal dengan mutu emas dan ketukangannya, Tin Sing menggajikan kira-kira 20 tukang mahir pada musim kemuncaknya dari tahun 1950-an hingga 1970-an. Tertarik dengan ketukangan Tin Sing, pelanggan seperti ahli politik, isteri hartawan, ratu cantik dan selebriti antarabangsa termasuk Fung Bo-bo, Jenny Tseng dan Li Li-hua kerap mengunjungi kedainya.\nTin Sing juga merupakan tukang emas yang dicari untuk kerja tempahan, yang sering menjadi liputan berita. Contohnya, pingat emas yang menggambarkan dua ekor burung layang-layang kembali ke sarang, dihadiahkan oleh peminat pada tahun 1952 kepada bintang opera Kantonis Hong Kong Sek Yin-Tsi; dan pingat emas yang ditempah oleh Dewan Perniagaan dan Perusahaan Cina Singapura, disampaikan sebagai tanda penghargaan kepada Perdana Menteri ketika itu, Encik Lee Kuan Yew, pada upacara pembukaan rasmi bangunan dewan itu pada tahun 1964.\nDiuruskan oleh generasi kedua keluarga pengasas sekarang ini, Tin Sing kekal sebagai tukang emas tempatan yang dipercayai dan terus melayani pelanggan lama yang kembali membeli barang kemas untuk majlis khas atau reka bentuk tempahan tertentu.\nPembaris ini, yang digunakan oleh Tin Sin pada masa lalu, mengukur dalam inci tradisional Cina, yang berbeza daripada standard British.\nMinyak dan Balsam Ubat yang Dipercayai: Chop Wah On\nDiasaskan oleh Tong Chee Leong pada tahun 1916 di alamat 67 Pagoda Street, Chop Wah On ialah salah satu syarikat minyak dan balsam ubat tertua di Singapura.\nDikenali sebagai produk bermutu tetapi dijual pada harga yang berpatutan, Chop Wah On merupakan tempat persinggahan popular bagi kuli Cina dan wanita samsui yang kembali ke China untuk membeli hadiah, khususnya Red Flower Oil (‘Minyak Bunga Merah’). Anak lelaki sulung Tong, Tong Seng Mun, mengambil alih perniagaan pada tahun 1940-an dan terus mengekalkan harga murah untuk pelanggan kelas pekerjanya.\nKedai itu bukan sahaja melayani pelanggan tempatan, malah juga pelanggan dari China, di mana Chop Wah On telah membina reputasi yang kukuh hasil daripada generasi pendatang yang balik ke tanah air dengan membawa pulang produknya sebagai hadiah untuk keluarga dan rakan.\nSelaku peminat haiwan, Tong mengendalikan perdagangan haiwan eksotik dari belakang rumah kedai Pagoda Street sehingga tahun 1960-an, membekalkan haiwan kepada institut penyelidikan dan zoo di luar negara. Keluarga itu turut mengimbau kedatangan Sultan Ismail dari Johor, seorang rakan Tong dan rakan peminat haiwan, yang mengunjungi rumah kedai itu untuk melihat haiwan di situ beberapa kali. Pada tahun 1957, Tong juga membuka zoo di Pasir Panjang, lengkap dengan seekor singa laut dari Belanda.\nChop Wah On berpindah ke Upper Cross Street pada tahun 2000 dan kini dikendalikan oleh generasi ketiga keluarga Tong yang terus berkembang berdasarkan kepercayaan dan kesetiaan daripada generasi pelanggan yang mempercayai kemujaraban ubat-ubatannya.\nIni adalah pembungkusan yang pernah digunakan untuk produk pengasas Chop Wah On, dan ia mengandungi alamat lama kedai itu di 67 Pagoda Street dan 7 Smith Street.\nDaripada Barang Kemas Tradisional kepada Barang Kemas Halus: Mengenai Cheong Jewellery Barang Kemas On Cheong\nTerkenal dengan ketukangan dan reka bentuk barang kemas yang unik, On Cheong diasaskan pada 1936 oleh Ho Yew Ping yang berhijrah dari Guangdong, China pada 1925 dan menjadi perantis di pelbagai tukang emas di Malaya sebelum berpindah ke Singapura.\nHo menubuhkan kedai pertamanya bersama rakan di North Bridge Road menjual aksesori perak dan emas, dan menamakan perniagaan itu “On Cheong” yang diterjemahkan kepada “keamanan dan kemakmuran” dalam bahasa Kantonis, yang mencerminkan keinginan pendatang pada masa yang tidak menentu itu.\nPada tahun 1941, Ho memindahkan On Cheong ke alamat 251 South Bridge Road kerana beliau berharap kepadatan penduduk Chinatown yang lebih tinggi akan menghasilkan lebih ramai pelanggan dan, sebagai orang Kantonis sendiri, berpendapat adalah lebih mudah menjalankan perniagaan dengan pelanggan yang kebanyakannya Kantonis.\nSehingga tahun 1990-an, On Cheong adalah tukang emas yang dipercayai oleh para pelanggan yang membeli emas untuk dijadikan  simpanan. Walau bagaimanapun, apabila lebih ramai rakyat Singapura mula membeli barang kemas untuk kegunaan peribadi, Ho Nai Chuen, anak bongsu pengasas, memutuskan untuk memodenkan jenama itu, dan mula mengkhususkan syarikat dalam penghasilan kepingan jed yang jarang didapati dan reka bentuk barang kemas yang ditempah.\nKini sebagai pembekal barang kemas halus, On Cheong telah berjaya beralih kepada menawarkan reka bentuk barang kemas yang unik dan karya agung yang direka oleh pakar kepada para pelanggannya yang amat berpuas hati.\nPapan tanda perniagaan ini mengandungi nama Tukang Emas On Cheong dan anak syarikatnya Sin Thong Sin Keok yang menyediakan perkhidmatan pengiriman wang untuk pendatang Cina.\nDaripada Kacang Tanah kepada Pencuci Mulut Tradisional: Mei Heong Yuen\nTerkenal dengan pencuci mulut tradisionalnya hari ini, tidak ramai yang mungkin menyedari bahawa Mei Heong Yuen (“taman wangi” dalam bahasa Kantonis) mula beroperasi sebagai pengeluar kacang tanah panggang.\nPerniagaan itu diasaskan oleh Lee Chit Heng, yang bekerja dalam industri kacang panggang di Menglembu, Ipoh, sebelum berpindah ke Singapura pada 1940-an. Lee menubuhkan Mei Heong Yuen, yang menjual kacang Menglembu di Pagoda Street sebelum berpindah ke alamat 39 Temple Street.\nDipasarkan di bawah nama “Farmer Brand”, Mei Heong Yuen membekalkan kacang tanah kepada peruncit dan restoran tempatan, manakala kacang tanah yang baru dipanggang dijual mengikut berat di Temple Street. Menjelang 1970-an, kacang tanahnya telah dieksport ke rantau ini, Hong Kong, Eropah dan Amerika Syarikat. Walaupun eksport terus berkembang pada tahun 1990-an, perniagaan di Temple Street menghadapi persaingan sengit dengan pengenalan lebih banyak makanan ringan baru di pasaran.\nDalam usaha mempelbagaikan perniagaan dan mengekalkan keterampilan Mei Heong Yuen di Chinatown, anak perempuan Lee, Clara dan Connie, menghasilkan idea untuk menjual pencuci mulut tradisional Kantonis di kedai keluarga mereka di 67 Temple Street.\nUsaha itu terbukti berjaya dan Mei Heong Yuen telah berkembang ke beberapa cawangan di seluruh pulau, dan sebagai tanda hormat kepada warisan mereka, kacang tanah di bawah jenama Farmer Brand terus dijual di beberapa kedai pencuci mulut mereka hari ini.\nGambar James Lee, anak  pengasas Lee Chit Heng, ini diambil di kilang kacang tanah panggang keluarga di Malaysia, di mana produk Farmer Brand masih dihasilkan hari ini.", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/Street-Corner-Heritage-Galleries-Chinatown-Malay", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/Street-Corner-Heritage-Galleries-Chinatown/Banner-Image.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:21"},

Text by Clement Ong\nImages by Asian Civilisations Museum\nBeMuse Volume 6 Issue 3 - Oct to Dec 2013\nThe Asian Civilisations Museum displayed over 170 new acquisitions in the special exhibition Devotion and Desire: Cross-Cultural Art in Asia which ran until 8 December 2013. Objects acquired over 2009 to 2013 were mounted in the exhibition, most for the first time. Many of these works of art revealed the surprising connections between Asian cultures, and between Asia and the wider world. The exhibition highlighted a new direction for the museum, which had recently focused on collecting objects that have resulted from these interconnections.\nThe themes of the exhibition include the importance of trade, transmission of religions, courtly art, and colonial networks. For thousands of years, the cultures of Asia have traded, interacted, and exchanged ideas. These encounters have shaped our world, and they affect the way objects look. Religions moved from region to region, special objects were eagerly sought in lands far away, and new works of art were created by the blending of different traditions.\nWhat is cross-cultural art?\nDefining cross-cultural art is complicated. Trying to understand, through our contemporary eyes, why an object looks the way it does often requires a supple mind and a familiarity with various artistic traditions. Many works of art were made by people who lived a world away from their intended consumers – and, therefore, did not necessarily share a language, religion, or aesthetic. Meaning and context are generated in unexpected ways, with crucial roles played by traders, agents, and consumers of various types. Art historians sometimes try to pinpoint the earliest occurrence of a motif or style in order to identify the “original” source of influence. Although this may be a useful starting point, it can also obscure the influence of creativity by later artists.\nCross-cultural art can result from an artist using ideas and styles from a foreign culture in order to produce new work. Whether the process is called copying, borrowing, emulating, or appropriation is of no importance. What is important and exciting is the process – the exchange of influences, whether facilitated by networks of trade, migration, pilgrimage, diplomacy, or any combination of these – and, of course, the resulting works of art.\nDevotion and Desire\nDesire for wealth, hard-to-obtain commodities, adventure, and objects of beauty has driven trade and the movements of people for a very long time. Devotion to gods, principles, charismatic leaders, and indeed, craft and art-making, has been and still is a major driving force in civilizations around the globe. The objects in the exhibition are products of these forces, and tell fascinating stories of the past.\nPeranakan art embodies this cross-cultural blending of ideas. As the descendants of foreign traders who settled and married local women, they adopted traits from their new home in the Malay world, while retaining much of their own culture, whether from China, India, or Europe. Peranakan art reflects diverse influences – it incorporates a complex mixture of styles and objects made in different parts of the world, which were commissioned or collected, and displayed together in a new context. The Peranakans provide an example for looking at the world: they remind us to look beyond the strict notions of nationality and ethnicity to discover the value of diverse communities.\nMany regions around the globe have been sites of exchange and blending. As peoples and religions spread to new lands, new adherents incorporate local customs into new belief. A spectacular example is the monumental head of a bodhisattva (fig. 1). Both the style and the religious significance of the work can be traced to other lands: it is a Buddhist figure, made in a style borrowed from Hellenistic art. It was made in the ancient kingdom of Gandhara (in what is today northern Pakistan), an important crossroads between East and West. Like the Malay Peninsula, it was a point of exchange for trade, religion, and art.\nFig. 1. Head of a bodhisattva, Gandhara, around 4th century, Terracotta, height 85 cm.\nAlexander the Great conquered parts of the Gandhara region in the 4th century BC. The state later transferred to the Indian Mauryan dynasty, whose King Ashoka (272–237 BC) converted to Buddhism. A succession of Greek and Bactrian rulers followed, until a long period of ability began under the Kushan kingdom (late 1 century until around 450 CE). These waves of influences left two profound effects on Gandharan art: Buddhism; and the realistic depiction of the human form influenced by Greek and Roman art – a mixture that gave rise to some of the earliest depictions of the Buddha and bodhisattvas.\nHinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Zoroastrianism, and Sikhism were all represented in works of art in the exhibition. Many of these objects are the result of varied artistic influence. For instance, Hinduism and Buddhism were transmitted from India to Southeast Asia in the first centuries of the Common Era. Imported ritual objects provided inspiration for local work, and Indian artists and merchants settled in towns along the trade routes and contributed to the creative process.\nThree images of the Virgin and Child show varied responses to Christianity in Asia. A porcelain model made at Dehua, China, with a base of swirling Chinese-style clouds, melds elements of Guanyin with the Virgin Mary (fig. 2).\nFig. 2. Virgin and Child, China, Dehua, Fujian province, late 17th or 18th century, Porcelain, height 39 cm.\nAn ivory sculpture shows the extraordinary skills of Sri Lankan carvers who worked for both Christian and Buddhist patrons (fig. 3).\nFig. 3. Virgin and Child, Sri Lanka, late 16th century, Ivory, height 32.5 cm.\nAnd a wooden Virgin and Child crafted in Timor-Leste is an example of a local artist’s interpretation of a Western sculptural style (fig. 4).\nFig. 4. Virgin and Child, Probably Timor-Leste, 19th century, Wood, pigments, height 73.7 cm.\nThe three sculptures all depict the same subject, but the stories of how they came to be are worlds apart.\nLocal religions dominate another section of the exhibition. In many cultures, ancestors are deeply respected and venerated. If properly attended to, ancestors would shower blessings upon the community and ensure bountiful harvests. In ancient China, vessels cast of bronze were used to offer food and wine during rituals dedicated to ancestors and the gods. Ritual vessels like a gui (fig. 5), richly decorated and exceptionally well preserved, were used by the elite. An array of impressive ritual bronzes was a display of power and prestige. These bronzes were often later buried in the tombs of their owners. Ancestor rituals not only showed respect but also emphasized the source of a ruler’s political authority.\nFig. 5. Ritual food vessel (Gui), China, Shaanxi province, early Western Zhou dynasty, late 11th or 10th century BC, Bronze, 22.1 x 27.6 x 18.6 cm.\nThe Austronesian peoples of Southeast Asia often represented their ancestors by producing figures made from wood, stone, or metal. Some are extremely simple – others grand and beautifully carved. A Hampatong guardian figure from central Borneo takes the form of a colonial-era soldier in Western- style military uniform (fig. 6). This shows that the Dayaks would even use powers from the world outside their community to ward off intruders from the spirit world.\nFig. 6. Hampatong guardian figure, Central Kalimantan (Indonesia), early 20th century, Ironwood, height 170 cm.\nThe desire to obtain money and goods through commerce has spurred the movements of people around the world for millennia. Much of the trade through the Indian Ocean centred around textiles from India and spices from Southeast Asia. A fine cotton textile (fig. 7), probably made for use as a bedspread or wall hanging, was produced on the Coromandel Coast of India. The bold floral patterns were popular in Europe at the time, and it was surely designed to appeal to that market.\nFig. 7. Hanging: Large flowers and cartouches, India, Coromandel Coast, early 18th century, Cotton; drawn and painted, resist and mordant dyed, 277 x 170.6cm.\nPorcelain and other goods from China were also coveted by much of the world, and for a time, the trade was strictly controlled. On display was a large bowl decorated with scenes of the lively waterfront at Guangzhou (Canton), the busiest trading port by the mid-18th century (fig. 8). Western trading companies were restricted to the “hongs”, as they were called, offices and residences abutting the port. Hong bowls like this were produced by Chinese artisans as souvenirs for wealthy foreign merchants.\nFig. 8. Hong Bowl, China, around 1785, Porcelain, height 15.5 cm, diameter 36 cm.\nLuxury goods made from tortoise shell, ivory, mother-of-pearl, silver and gold – even exotic woods – drove markets for art in many places. A small chest covered with iridescent mother-of-pearl plaques mounted with silver pins was produced in Gujarat in western India (fig. 9). Collectors in Renaissance Europe were dazzled by such objects, which could be found in princely collections throughout the region.\nFig. 9. Casket, India, Gujarat, 16th or 17th century, Mother-of-pearl, wood, gilded silver pins, engraved metal mounts, 15.5 x 23.5 x 13 cm.\nIt is perhaps appropriate to return to Peranakan art to complete the circle. A full-length portrait painted in oil of Madam Wellington Koo embodies the shifting identities of Peranakans in the modern world (fig. 10).\nFig. 10. Portrait of Madam Wellington Koo, By Charles Tharp (British, 1878 - 1951), 1921, Oil on canvas, 197 x 100 cm, Gift of Lim and Tan Securities Pte Ltd in memory of Johnny and Nancy Lim.\nBorn at the turn of the century into a wealthy family in Java, Oei Hui-lan (1899–1992) grew up there and in Singapore, speaking multiple languages, and learning to negotiate the colonial society of the day. She married Wellington Koo, an American-educated Chinese diplomat, and they lived at postings in Europe and America. Madam Koo moved easily through high society in the East and the West. Featured in Vogue magazine, she was equally comfortable in haute couture or the sarong kebaya; the shops of Paris, or the dusty streets of Java. And thus, we might view her as another in a long line of adventurers, traders, and negotiators along the many paths that combine cultures around the world. These interactions can produce works of great beauty. Some of them were on display here in Singapore in the past exhibition at the Asian Civilisations Museum.\nClement Onn is Curator, Cross-Culture, Asian Civilisations Museum.", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/crossing-cultures-devotion-and-desire-cross-cultural-art-in-asia/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/crossing-cultures-devotion-and-desire-cross-cultural-art-in-asia/crossing-cultures-cross-cultural-art-in-asia-1.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:21"},

Introduction\nAbout the Street Corner Heritage Galleries scheme\nThe Street Corner Heritage Galleries scheme is a collaborative effort between NHB museums, heritage institutions and community galleries, and local shop owners in their respective precincts to strengthen partnerships with communities and raise awareness of and foster deeper appreciation for heritage in everyday spaces.\nThe scheme allows NHB to work closely with local shop owners with at least 30 years of history in selected precincts to co-create \"mini-museums\" that showcase the history and heritage of their respective businesses and trades. Located on site, these galleries will display historical documents, photographs, and artefacts that tell the stories of these shops.\nOn top of providing funding, curatorial support and assistance in fabricating the showcases, NHB will also work with local shop owners to develop programmes such as talks, tours, and workshops, and provide opportunities to participate in key NHB events such as the Singapore Heritage Festival and the respective CultureFests of the heritage institutions within their precincts.\n  老店铺文化站: 牛车水\nதெருமுனை மரபுடைமைக் காட்சிக்கூடம்: சைனாடவுன்\nGaleri Warisan Sudut Jalan: Chinatown\nMedical Care for Mankind: Eu Yan Sang\nThe story of Eu Yan Sang started in 1873 when Eu Kong, an immigrant from Guangdong, China, arrived in Perak, Malaya where he observed that tin miners often turned to opium to ease their pains.\nConvinced that traditional Chinese medicine could provide better pain management and treat ailments, Eu opened a medical hall in Gopeng, Perak in 1879, naming it “Yan Sang”, which translates to “caring for mankind” in Cantonese.\nWhen Eu Kong passed away, his son, Eu Tong Sen, took over the business at the age of 21. Armed with an astute business acumen, Tong Sen expanded the family’s business from traditional medicine to tin mines, rubber plantations and properties. Determined to free tin miners from their opium addiction, he set up medical halls near his tin mines to provide medical care for miners.\nBy the 1910s, the family’s traditional Chinese medicine business, rebranded as “Eu Yan Sang”, had extended to Singapore, Hong Kong, and southern China. In 1910, the first Eu Yan Sang medical hall in Singapore opened at 265-271 South Bridge Road. Besides providing affordable healthcare and medical supplies, Eu Yan Sang medical halls also provided remittance services and its shop assistants would help illiterate migrants read and pen letters.\nToday, Eu Yan Sang continues the founder’s mission of caring for mankind through traditional medicine, operating over 200 retail outlets and clinics in the region.\nThis knife was used in the past by Eu Yan Sang’s herbalists to slice and trim herbs used in prescriptions.\nTraditional Taste of Bak Kwa: Lim Chee Guan\nFamed for its snaking queues during festive periods, Lim Chee Guan was established by Lim Kay Eng who arrived from Fujian, China in the 1920s. Defying his parents’ wishes for him to be a doctor, Lim toiled in plantations and shops before saving enough to start a pushcart business selling bak kwa (barbecued meat slices) along Chin Chew Road in 1938.\nLim named the business “Lim Chee Guan”,  which translates to “ambition and integrity” in Mandarin. He made bak kwa using his mother’s recipe and adapted the marinade of the meat to suit local tastes. Lim also experimented on the preparation process, such as sun-drying the meat and barbecuing it over charcoal to give it a distinctive smoky taste.\nIn 1956, Lim relocated to a rented shophouse along New Bridge Road where half the shop was used for bak kwa production and the other half for retail. Lim and his family would spend most of their free time at the shop and this family tradition of helping out in the business is still practised by the second and third generations of the Lim family, who currently run the business.\nTo this day, Lim Chee Guan holds a special place in the hearts of its long-time customers, many of whom do not mind the long queues and in fact, regard queuing for the shop’s bak kwa as a Lunar New Year tradition.\nThis pair of tongs was used to flip slices of meat during the barbecuing process as it was easier to wield compared to wooden chopsticks, which were used in the past.\nFrom Silver to Peranakan Jewellery: Kim Poh Hong Goldsmith\nFor more than 80 years, Kim Poh Hong Goldsmith has been crafting and selling jewellery to generations of customers. The business was founded at 58 China Street in 1938 by Tan Eng Geok, a silversmith who came to Singapore from Kinmen, China.\nDuring its early years, Kim Poh Hong sold silver jewellery from local wholesalers, as well as handcrafted pieces by Tan. Its customers, who were mainly Hokkiens, would frequent the shop to purchase special items such as silver amulet holders for newborns and burial jewellery for the deceased. The shop also traded gold jewellery, notably reddish gold pieces preferred by Hokkien customers.\nIn 1943, Tan established Poh Huat Goldsmiths at North Bridge Road with friends and by the 1950s, both shops had become known for their workmanship and custom-made jewellery. Poh Huat was frequented more by Malay, Indian and Nonya customers due to the make-up of the community in the area.\nThe Tan family bought over Poh Huat Goldsmiths in 1971 when the founders retired and subsequently merged it with Kim Poh Hong. When China Street underwent redevelopment in the 1990s, Kim Poh Hong relocated and eventually settled at Pickering Street in 2002. \nToday, Kim Poh Hong is run by the third generation of the Tan family and has carved a niche in designing enamel and Peranakan jewellery.\nThis wedding gift voucher issued in the 1950s by Kim Poh Hong was commonly purchased by family members as gifts to newlyweds.\nCantonese Cuisine for Local Palates: Spring Court Restaurant\nOne of the oldest restaurants in Singapore, Spring Court was established at Great World Amusement Park in 1929 by lorry driver turned restaurateur, Ho Loke Yee.\nOriginally named “Wing Choon Yuen” (“singing in a spring garden” in Cantonese), the restaurant was reputed for its localised Cantonese fare, which incorporated ingredients from Malay, Indian, Hokkien and Teochew cuisines, such as chilli and curry powder, and featured stronger flavours than traditional Cantonese cuisine. \nDuring the 1930s to 1960s, Wing Choon Yuen was where elite, dignitaries, associations and newlyweds would flock to for celebratory feasts. With its capacity of 100 tables, the restaurant often hosted three or four wedding banquets per night. In fact, business was so brisk that Ho often had to sleep over at the restaurant on a makeshift bed of dining tables.\nHowever, by the 1970s, business declined as the number of visitors to Great World dwindled. Wing Choon Yuen then relocated to New Bridge Road in 1978, renaming itself “Spring Court” while retaining its Chinese name, before settling at Upper Cross Street in 2004.\nFor many Singaporean Chinese families, celebrating Lunar New Year at Spring Court has become an annual tradition. Today, the restaurant is run by the third generation of the Ho family who remains committed to preserving local Chinese food heritage and offering a Singaporean interpretation of Cantonese cuisine to the younger generation.\nThis photograph shows a wedding banquet held at Wing Choon Yuen when it was located at Great World Amusement Park and regarded as a grand venue to hold weddings.\nFrom Traditional Teahouse to Delicious Pastries: Tong Heng\nRecognised for its diamond-shaped egg tarts today, Tong Heng has its roots as a pre-war establishment known as Huang Hou Teahouse.\nIts founder, Fong Chee Heng, who arrived in the 1910s from Guangdong, China, started out as an itinerant hawker peddling drinks in various teahouses. With savings accumulated over the years, Fong bought over the teahouse on Smith Street in 1934, which was later renamed “Tong Heng”.\nTeahouses like Tong Heng were a cornerstone of Cantonese culture in pre-war Chinatown where patrons would gather to drink tea, enjoy confectioneries and chat. Located across opera theatre Lai Chun Yuen, Tong Heng was also where fans would purchase sweet treats for their favourite stars.\nAfter World War II, many of Chinatown’s teahouses transformed themselves into eating houses, but Tong Heng persevered with the making of confectioneries. In the 1960s, the family installed a showcase displaying egg tarts baked in different shapes to attract more customers. This strategy proved to be highly successful, and Tong Heng became well-known as a confectionery store offering egg tarts and traditional Cantonese wedding pastries.\nTong Heng had to vacate its premises on Smith Street in the 1980s due to the redevelopment of the area and relocated to its current location on South Bridge Road. Today, Tong Heng is run by fourth generation descendants and continues to be an icon of Chinatown.\nThis custom-made gift box was used to contain wedding jewellery and delivered as part of the package when customers ordered wedding confectioneries.\nBeautiful and Aromatic Barbecued Meat: Bee Cheng Hiang\nBee Cheng Hiang started in the 1930s as a roadside stall selling bak kwa (barbecued meat slices) near the former Majestic Theatre in Chinatown. The business was founded by Teo Swee Ee, who subsequently opened his first shop at Rochor Road.\nThe family named the business “Bee Cheng Hiang” and each Chinese character of its name is composed of nine strokes to signify longevity in Chinese culture. It was also a representation of the Bee Cheng Hiang experience, where the bak kwa is touted as “beautiful, aromatic delicacies”.\nTeo was an astute businessman with strong marketing instincts. From the 1950s, Bee Cheng Hiang, then spelled as “Bee Chun Heng”, advertised regularly, sponsored radio programmes and participated in trade expositions.\nBy the 1970s, Bee Cheng Hiang had expanded and set up several branches in the city area. This New Bridge Road branch quickly became an icon in Chinatown where queues would form round the block during festive seasons.\nThough Bee Cheng Hiang has grown into a multinational company, it continues to employ traditional production methods where possible, such as spreading meat slices on bamboo trays by hand. It is this emphasis on tradition that explains why long-time customers return again and again – for bak kwa which remains true to the taste they grew up with.\nThis receipt was issued in 1972 by the Singapore government for Bee Cheng Hiang’s food licence application to operate the branch at New Bridge Road.\nHallmark of Quality Tea: Pek Sin Choon\nOne of the oldest tea merchants in Singapore, Pek Sin Choon was founded in 1925 by Bai-Zhuang Dan Niang and her son Pek Kim Aw.\nBai-Zhuang moved to Singapore in 1910 from Anxi, China after the death of Pek’s father so that Pek could apprentice at his uncle’s tea shop here and learn the trade. Pek left his uncle’s shop after gaining some experience to work in Indonesia as a labourer, before returning to Singapore to set up his own tea business.\nTo build his own clientele, Pek would carry tea on a shoulder pole, selling it door-to-door to businesses and residents in the city area. By 1925, Pek saved enough to set up his own shop on George Street. He chose the buffalo as the brand’s mascot because he was nicknamed “Buffalo Head” by his associates due to his strongheaded character. Pek Sin Choon gradually gained a reputation for its quality tea blends over the years.\nAs quality teas became the hallmark of Pek Sin Choon, Pek instilled a culture where every family and staff member must acquire deep knowledge in the preparation and brewing of tea.\nRun by the fourth generation today, Pek Sin Choon continues to be known as a leading wholesaler and retailer of premium Chinese tea, and is sought after by clients looking for its bespoke tea blends.\nThis is a photograph of founder Pek Kim Aw, taken in the 1960s, with the tea set used for sampling tea.\nHousehold Name for Quality Gold: Tin Sing Goldsmiths\nFounded in 1937 by the Wong, Wan and Chow families, Tin Sing is one of the last pre-war goldsmiths located along South Bridge Road.\nUntil the 1970s, gold was regarded as a traditional means of savings and goldsmiths such as Tin Sing often saw customers queueing to purchase gold on pay days. Tin Sing was particularly popular as it guaranteed buyback of its jewellery during a time when few goldsmiths offered such an assurance.\nRenowned for the quality of its gold and craftsmanship, Tin Sing employed some 20 master craftsmen at its peak from the 1950s to 1970s. Drawn by Tin Sing’s craftsmanship, patrons like politicians, tycoons’ wives, pageant queens and international celebrities such as Fung Bo-bo, Jenny Tseng and Li Li-hua regularly graced its shop floor.\nTin Sing was also the go-to jeweller for commissioned works, which often made headlines. Examples include a gold medallion depicting two swallows returning to a nest, gifted by a fan in 1952 to Hong Kong Cantonese opera star Sek Yin-Tsi; and a gold medallion commissioned by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, presented as a token of appreciation to then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew at the official opening of the chamber’s building in 1964.\nManaged by the second generation of the founding families today, Tin Sing remains a trusted local jeweller and continues to serve long-time customers who return to purchase pieces for special occasions or commission custom designs.\nThis ruler, used by Tin Sing in the past, measures in traditional Chinese inches, which differ from the imperial standard.\nTrusted Medicated Oils and Balms: Chop Wah On\nFounded by Tong Chee Leong in 1916 at 67 Pagoda Street, Chop Wah On is one of the oldest medicated oil and balm companies in Singapore.\nReputed for its quality yet affordable products, Chop Wah On was a popular stop for Chinese coolies and Samsui women returning to China to stock up on gifts, in particular its Red Flower Oil. Tong’s eldest son, Tong Seng Mun, took over the business in the 1940s and continued to keep prices low for its working-class customers.\nThe shop not only serves local customers, but also customers from China, where Chop Wah On has built a strong reputation thanks to generations of returning immigrants bringing its products home as gifts for family and friends.\nAn animal enthusiast, Tong operated an exotic animal trade from the back of the Pagoda Street shophouse up to the 1960s, supplying animals to research institutes and zoos overseas. The family recalled the Sultan Ismail of Johor, a friend of Tong and fellow animal enthusiast, visiting the shophouse incognito to view the animals a number of times. In 1957, Tong also opened a zoo in Pasir Panjang, complete with a sea lion from the Netherlands.\nChop Wah On relocated to Upper Cross Street in 2000 and is now run by the third generation of the Tong family who continues to build upon the trust and loyalty from generations of customers who swear by its remedies.\nThese are former packaging used for Chop Wah On’s founding products, and they bear the shop’s former addresses at 67 Pagoda Street and 7 Smith Street.\nFrom Traditional to Fine Jewellery: On Cheong Jewellery\nKnown for its craftsmanship and unique jewellery designs, On Cheong was founded in 1936 by Ho Yew Ping who immigrated from Guangdong, China in 1925 and apprenticed at various goldsmiths in Malaya before moving to Singapore.\nHo set up his first shop with friends at North Bridge Road selling silver and gold accessories, and named the business “On Cheong”, which translates to “peace and prosperity” in Cantonese, reflecting the desires of immigrants in those uncertain times.\nIn 1941, Ho relocated On Cheong to 251 South Bridge Road as he hoped that Chinatown’s higher population density would result in more customers and, as a Cantonese person himself, felt that it would be easier doing business with a predominantly Cantonese clientele. \nUp till the 1990s, On Cheong was primarily a trusted goldsmith for customers who bought gold as a means of savings. However, as more Singaporeans began buying jewellery for personal use, Ho Nai Chuen, the founder’s youngest son, decided to modernise the brand, and started specialising in rare jade pieces and customised jewellery designs.\nNow an established purveyor of fine jewellery, On Cheong has successfully pivoted to offering unique jewellery designs and expertly crafted masterpieces to appreciative customers.\nThis business sign bears the names of On Cheong Goldsmiths and its subsidiary Sin Thong Sin Keok, which provided remittance services for Chinese immigrants.\nFrom Peanuts to Traditional Desserts: Mei Heong Yuen\nKnown for its traditional desserts today, few might be aware that Mei Heong Yuen (“fragrant garden” in Cantonese) first began operations as a producer of roasted peanuts.\nThe business was founded by Lee Chit Heng, who worked in the roasted peanut industry in Menglembu, Ipoh, before relocating to Singapore in the 1940s. Lee established Mei Heong Yuen, which sold Menglembu peanuts on Pagoda Street before relocating to 39 Temple Street.\nMarketed under the name “Farmer Brand”, Mei Heong Yuen supplied peanuts to local retailers and restaurants, while freshly roasted peanuts were sold by weight at Temple Street. By the 1970s, its peanuts were exported to Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, Europe, and the United States. While exports continued to flourish in the 1990s, business on Temple Street faced stiff competition with the introduction of more novel snacks in the market. \nIn an attempt to diversify the business and retain Mei Heong Yuen’s presence in Chinatown, Lee’s daughters, Clara and Connie, came up with the idea of selling traditional Cantonese desserts at the family’s shop at 67 Temple Street.\nThe venture proved successful and Mei Heong Yuen has expanded to several outlets across the island, and as a nod to their heritage, Farmer Brand peanuts continue to be sold at some of their dessert shops today.\nThis photograph of James Lee, son of founder Lee Chit Heng, was taken at the family’s roasted peanuts factory in Malaysia, where Farmer Brand products are still manufactured today.", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/Street-Corner-Heritage-Galleries-Chinatown", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/Street-Corner-Heritage-Galleries-Chinatown/Banner-Image.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:21"},

This exhibition celebrated the partnership between man and horse, in both work and play, within numerous cultures around the world.\nText by Chua Mei Lin\nBe Muse Volume 7 Issue 2 - Apr to Jun 2014\nHorses for Courses explored the history and development of horses, from the wild early years to the highly selective breeding of the present day. This exhibition celebrated the partnership between man and horse, in both work and play, within numerous cultures around the world.\nPicture of the exhibition hall\nA range of philatelic materials highlights the horse’s role in agriculture, postal delivery, war, racing, and other areas. Horses have long been a reliable form of transportation and recreation for man. From myths and legends to art and hobby, Horses for Courses took visitors on a journey that revealed the strength, speed and loyalty of this noble creature.\nWall display at the exhibition\nWay Back Then\nThe horse species Equus caballus, is from the Equidae family. It is a mammal that can be traced back some 50 million years.\nThe early ancestors were the size of small dogs and lived in Europe and North America. Over millions of years, the horse became taller with longer legs. It evolved to have one main toe (hoof); its neck lengthened with a light arch, and its teeth adapted to graze on grass, instead of chomping on leaves from plants.\nDuring the Stone Age, horses were hunted for meat. In some parts of Europe, early depictions of horses were from cave paintings from this period. It’s believed that wild horses roamed the plains of Asia and Europe about 30,000 years ago. But as the world changed, and as man began to encroach on their land, the number of wild horses started to dwindle. The only remaining wild horses today are the endangered Przewalski’s horses, with only about 250 roaming wild in their native home in Mongolia.\nProgress and Civilisation\nAbout 4,500 years ago, man started to domesticate horses for transportation and to move heavy loads. Engravings, sculptures, and writings show that horses were used to draw chariots – especially for burials – in early civilisations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, China and India.\nThe Egyptians were renowned for their skill in crafting swift chariots to carry archers for warfare, for example. The terracotta steeds buried alongside the soldiers in Xi’an, China, are also a testament to their importance in Chinese warfare.\nThe Umayyads, circa 650 AD, used well-trained Arabian horses for numerous successful raids and battles that created a vast empire stretching from the Middle East to France. And around the 13th century, Mongols led by Genghis Khan conquered a great expanse of land across continental Asia, Middle East and Eastern Europe. The secret to the Mongols’ success, it is said, was in using three to four horses in their battles and travels. As soon as one horse tired, another would take its place. In this manner, the Mongols’ journeys and cavalry attacks were continuous.\nHorses in the Americas disappeared with climatic changes but the Spaniards brought them back to North America during their conquests. Native Americans discovered the horses' usefulness and soon mastered the skill of horse riding for herding and warfare. Wild horses in North America are not considered truly wild; they are feral. A long time ago, these horses were domesticated by man but they were either returned to the wild, or escaped to wander free.\nRiding into History\nIdeas, language, culture, knowledge, and religion developed more efficiently in societies that harnessed horsepower. In Central Asia, for instance, horses enabled the transmission of discoveries such as paper, iron, printing and gunpowder across great distances.\nIn medieval times, armoured knights often formed the main thrust of attack but this eventually gave way to an artillery offensive. Seafaring European nations spread their influence and power across different continents - aided by horses for inland conquests.\nMail Delivery\nMan relied on horsepower before the advent of motorised transportation. Letters and parcels were delivered by men on horses or in carriages. In the United States, the Pony Express (1860) was a relay system which spanned the distance from Missouri to California, over the Ro y Mountains. It took horseback riders about 10 days to cover a distance of over 3,000 km.\nStamps featuring mail delivery by horse\nAccessories\nSaddle\nIn early times, man rode on horses bareback, or with a piece of cloth or blanket. From around the 3rd century BC, leather saddles were introduced. With the use of stirrups, riders - especially warriors - were better able to keep their balance on a horse.\nThere are two main types of modern saddles. The Western has a high pommel in the front, which is useful for hanging a lariat – a rope in the form of a lasso. At the back is a large cantle for better seat support. These features provide the rider with more comfort, especially when herding cattle. The English saddle is less padded and generally lighter.\nHorseshoes\nHorseshoes are usually U-shaped and they are nailed to the horse’s hooves to protect them from the hard ground. Most horses are checked by a farrier or horse shoe fitter every six to eight weeks to tidy the hooves.\nHistory & Culture\nHorses often connote honour, intelligence, bravery, and many artists have depicted these qualities in art. Here are some philatelic examples showing man and horse through history, art and culture.\nAustria: Lipizzaner\nStamp of Lipizzaner\nThe Lipizzan is closely associated with the Spanish Riding School of Vienna in Austria. The horses are trained in the school to perform the elegant movements and jumps of classical dressage, including what is also known as “haute ecole”, or “high school” jumps. The ‘dancing’ Lipizzaner, a Spanish-Andalusian breed, can be traced back to the 7th century when Barb horses were brought into Spain by the Moors and crossed with native Spanish horses.\nChina: Qi Jiguang\nStamp of Qi Jiguang\nQi Jiguang was a Chinese military general and national hero during the Ming Dynasty of the 16th century. He was noted for his courage and leadership in the fight again Japanese pirates along the east coast of China, as well as his work on the Great Wall of China. Here, he is depicted riding his horse ready for battle.\nChina: Chinese Opera\nStamp of Chinese Opera\nThe use of symbolic representation is a primary feature in Chinese opera. In this picture, for example, the use of a fringed cane is to signify riding a horse.\nHungary: Arrival of the Hungarians\nStamp of Arrival of the Hungarians\nThe painting by Árpád Feszty and other artists depicts the Arrival of the Hungarians (on horses) to the Carpathian Basin in 895. It was completed in 1894 to mark the 1,000th anniversary of the event. This cyclorama – a panoramic painting framed in a cylindrical platform - measures 115 metres by 15 metres and is housed in the National Historical Memorial Park in Ópusztaszer, Hungary.\nJersey: The Black Horse of St. Ouen\nStamp of The Black Horse of St. Ouen\nLong ago, Jersey was ruled by the French – much to the unhappiness of the islanders. One such person was Philippe de Carteret, the Seigneur of St. Ouen and a member of the island’s most influential family. To prevent any problems, the French soldiers decided to kidnap him. Philippe tried to escape on his black horse, and raced toward his manor across a deep wide ditch. His horse jumped and cleared it and returned Philippe to his home safely. But his faithful horse soon collapsed and died. To honour his horse, Philippe had the animal buried in his garden.\nKyrgyzstan: “Kyz Koomay”\nStamp of Kyz Koomay\nThe stamp depicts a popular game in Kyrgyzstan, where a young man has to try and overtake a young woman – while both of them are on horseback. The woman usually rides a faster horse and starts about ten seconds ahead of the man. If he catches her, he is rewarded with a kiss. If he does not, the woman can then whip him.\nMongolia: Morin Khuur\nStamp of Morin Khuur\nThe Morin Khuur is a horse head-shaped fiddle. It has two rings and is played with a bow usually rung with horsehair. Traditional folk songs are often accompanied by the wistful resonance of the instrument, which is said to mimic a horse’s neigh or the wind whistling across the Mongolian plains.\nKyrgyzstan: “Kok-Boru” (Blue Wolf)\nStamp of \"Kok-Boru\"\nMongolia: The Secret History of Mongols\nStamp of The Secret History of the Mongols\nIt is generally agreed that the Uyghur-scripted literature, “The Secret History of the Mongols”, was produced around the 13th century after Genghis Khan’s death. Even though it is a compilation of folklore and myth, the 12 chapters serve as a significant reference to the history, culture, and genealogy of the Mongol Empire.\nThe people of Mongolia are fond of horse racing, wrestling and archery, often known as the “three games of men”. Horses feature prominently in their lives. Horses and riders were decorated in colourful silks and ribbons during the races, which cover distances from 15 to 30 km.\nPoland: Knight Tournament\nStamp of Knight Tournament\nThe first modern knight tournament was held in Poland in 1977. Participants dressed as knights arrived from all over Europe to compete in medieval games, as depicted in these stamps.\nSingapore: Kuda Kepang\nStamp of Kuda Kepang\nKuda Kepang or Kuda Lumping is a type of dance that originated from Java, in which the dancer dons a colourful horse costume. The dance is said to be a re-enactment of battles again the Dutch, but these days it is performed more for entertainment or celebrations. Another version of this dance induces a trance on the dancer, who then mimics the behaviour of horses.\nPortugal: Lusitano Horses\nStamp of Lusitano Horses\nThe Lusitano, named in 1966 after Portugal’s ancient Roman name, is closely related to the Spanish-Andalusian horse. Lusitanos have competed in the Olympics and World Equestrian Games. In early times, they were deployed for war but these days they only participate in bloodless bullfighting.\nUkraine: Straw horse\nStamp of Straw Horse\nLocated in a region blessed with rich ‘black soil’, Ukraine has abundant wheat. After the grain is removed, the raw is used to feed animals, for housing, and to make traditional handicrafts.\nUnited Kingdom: All the Queen’s Horses\nStamp of All the Queen's Horses\nTo mark the British Horse Society’s 50th anniversary, four stamps were issued that featured Queen Elizabeth II’s ceremonial horses: two carriage horses from the Royal Mews, and two from the Household Cavalry.\nUnited States: Cherokee Strip Land Run\nStamp of Cherokee Strip Land Run\nThe Cherokee Strip was an 8 million-acre piece of land in Northwest Oklahoma. In the late 1830s, the government moved the Cherokee tribe to eastern Oklahoma, and the natives were given a passage, known as the Cherokee Strip, to the western hunting ground.\nIn the early 1880s, many cattle ranches were established in the area. It was during this period that the term “cowboy” was coined and that the expansion of the American West began. In 1893, by presidential order, the Cherokee Strip was opened for settlement. This resulted in the great land race, where more than 100,000 people rushed to lay claim on land.\n» Chua Mei Lin is Curator, Singapore Philatelic Museum", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/horses-for-courses/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/horses-for-courses/horses-for-courses-cover.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:23"},

Well, we sure did, and here are some insights into our afternoon chats over kopi with these champions of Chinese heritage and culture. Ever wondered what clans and associations in Singapore do? Well, we sure did, and here are some insights into our afternoon chats over kopi with these champions of Chinese heritage and culture.\nResiding in the colourful shophouses along Chinatown, many are aware of the existence of clans and associations, but our understanding of them is often less clear.\nA common one would be that they have ties to secret societies, according to Jack Tan, the 56-year-old Vice Secretary of the Chin Woo Athletic Association. However, he clarifies, the association conducts a careful screening of their members for links with secret society gangs as well as criminal activity, so that's one myth debunked.\nAnother is the belief that members of clans and associations comprise the elderly, and all they do is gather to chat and drink tea. Well, you may actually see members chatting over tea, but it is certainly not all they do.\nWhile their day-to-day operations may not be the most glamorous, these clans and associations are culturally significant. Each representing a different cultural aspect of the Chinese community in Singapore, they play an integral role in preserving an important piece of our history.\nPreserving Nanyin\nFounded in 1941, Siong Leng Musical Association aims to promote and preserve traditional Nanyin music and Liyuan opera in Singapore. But what exactly is Nanyin music? Loosely translated, it means \"music from the South\", where the province of Fujian is in China.\nProject Manager of Siong Leng, Seow Ming Xian, 23, explains, \"Nanyin music originates from Fujian. The masters write books, articles, research papers and songs about Nanyin, but there are no documents in English that we can show to the English speaking community.\"\nSeow Ming Xian, Project Manager of Siong Leng (left), with fellow members.\nHence, to bring its art to the uninitiated, Siong Leng performs annually at various places such as Thian Hock Keng and Kusu Island. The association also stages major productions locally and participates in music festivals overseas, gaining international recognition for its art forms.\nBesides its yearly heritage performances and artistic productions, perhaps Siong Leng’s most important work resides in the translating and digitally archiving of Nanyin documents from the masters in the Fujian province of China. These documents mostly exist as physical copies, and the association is working on a cloud archival system to make these resources more accessible and available to everyone.\nAre You a Li?\nA traditional surname clan, Kwong Wai Siew Li Si She Shut takes in only members of the Li clan and family, as opposed to cultural clans and associations where membership is open to anyone.\nWhile Kwong Wai Siew Li Si She Shut was initially set up 140 years ago to help the Li immigrants from China find jobs, housing, and to provide them with a place of shelter, that role has obviously ceased over time.\nLee Wai Ching (bottom right) with other clan members\nThe clan now serves as a generational legacy that seeks to preserve the spirit of community within the Li clan and family. During Chinese festivals such as the Lunar New Year, Mid-Autumn festival and Dragon Boat festival, the clan will organise a huge celebration and invite members and their families to participate. Through these cultural festivals, the clan members try to teach the younger generations the meanings behind the festivals, to nurture their appreciation of Chinese heritage.\nValues through Sports\nServing as a sports school in the olden days, where there were no public gyms or sports facilities, Chin Woo Athletic Association offered members training for a variety of sports when it was founded in 1921.\nOver the years, the association has built up a reputation for its impressive lion dance and martial arts performances, and its members often perform at various festivals and events. In addition to performing, Chin Woo also teaches its motto to members as a way of passing down its culture and heritage. Translated to English, it reads, “Love one’s country, cultivate one’s character, righteousness, and helping others.”\nJack Tan, the 56-year-old Vice Secretary of Chin Woo Athletic Association, adds, “We teach them the Chin Woo motto so that they understand how to be loyal to our country, and be self-disciplined and kind to people. These are all part of Chinese values.”\nKwong Yuen Hung, General Secretary of Chin Woo (left) and Jack Tan, Vice Secretary of Chin Woo\nWhat most may not know, though, is that Chin Woo’s history has strong ties with Singapore’s history, and one that the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew played a part in. According to the General Secretary of Chin Woo, Kwong Yuen Hung, Mr Lee used to watch their practice sessions as a boy at their training grounds, now known as Duxton Plain Park.\nKwong, 80, reveals that the values of Chin Woo resonated so strongly with Mr Lee that in 1965, he made a speech to the members of the association about enlisting in the army.\nThe Challenges Ahead\nThough their cultural and historical significance is acknowledged, all three organisations admit that they face difficulties in keeping up with the times, especially when it comes to recruiting younger members.\nWhile it is challenging, efforts have been made to reach out to the younger folk, and capture their interest. Siong Leng fuses its traditional Nanyin music with current genres like jazz; Kwong Wai Siew is planning to create an online presence; while Chin Woo tailors its performances to make them fun and enjoyable for the young, and organises overseas trips and performances. In the face of progress and modernisation, the associations will continue to work hard to capture the hearts and commitment of the next generation.\nThis article was developed for Singapore Heritage Festival 2017.", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/kopi-talk-with-our-clans-and-associations/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/clans/chin-woo_1.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:23"},

Over the past two millennia, Indian, Chinese, Islamic, regional and European influences prevailed at different times. By Heidi Tan, Senior Curator, Southeast Asia Asian Civilisations Museum\nImages: Asian Civilisations Museum\nBeMuse Volume 3 Issue 3 – Jul to Sep 2010\nA Centre for Cultural Exchanges\nSumatra’s position along the Straits of Malacca has resulted in a cultural legacy that illustrates how various streams of influence took place. Over the past two millennia, Indian, Chinese, Islamic, regional and European influences prevailed at different times.\nThe material cultures presented in the exhibition Sumatra: Isle of Gold included Bronze-Age objects of the early Austronesian communities, Hindu-Buddhist materials of the maritime kingdom of Srivijaya (7th-13th centuries), Chinese materials both imported and locally made, court arts of the coastal Islamic sultanates such as Aceh, Jambi and Palembang, Riau-Lingga and Siak. Artefacts that show interactions with remote cultures such as Batak and Nias and objects made in response to European influence during the colonial period, one also included.\nIndian Influences – The Legacy of Ancient Hindu-Buddhist Kingdoms\nIndian sources from the 3rd century BCE and later mention of Suvarnadvipa or ‘Gold Island’, which probably included the region and later Sumatra. Although gold was mined in Sumatra, natural resources such as benzoin (a fragrant resin used in perfumery and ritual offerings), camphor (another aromatic resin obtained from a forest tree) and by the 15th century, pepper, were highly sought after by overseas markets. These goods were traded for prized imported commodities such as Indian printed cloth and Chinese ceramics.\nLarge ritual vessel. Bronze. C.500 BCE. Kerinci. South Sumatra.\nCollection of the National Museum of Indonesia.\nHindu-Buddhist traditions probably arrived from India during the early centuries of the Common Era. The writings of the Chinese monk and pilgrim Yi Jing, provide some of the earliest evidence of the Srivijaya kingdom and Buddhist centre at Palembang during the late 7th century. Additional evidence for this kingdom arises from several inscriptions in the Indian Pallava script such as the Kota Kapur stele (dated 686 CE) from Bangka Island off the east coast of Sumatra. The stele’s location indicates an extensive network rather than a state with defined borders. It also provides evidence for the use of Indic scripts as the foundations of Old Malay and other local written languages.\nStele with Inscription. Stone. Dated to 686 CE. Kota Kapur. Bangka Island.\nCollection of National Museum of Indonesia.\nPalembang’s authority declined following Javanese attacks during the late 10th and 13th centuries, and the invasion of Indian Chola armies in the early 11th century. Eventually, the Malayu kingdom took control, but was forced to give way to the East Javanese kingdoms of Singhasari and then Majapahit during the 14th century. Malayu eventually withdrew inland to the Padang highlands, leaving behind an artistic legacy that reflects strong Javanese influences and the practice of Tantric Buddhism.\nTrade with India also left its mark in the textile traditions of the wealthy elites. Large Indian trade cloths of the 17th century – the precursors of later batik designs – were worn by aristocrats, whilst the sumptuous songket weaving tradition produced shimmering cloths of gold that are still highly prized today.\nShoulder cloth with garuda motifs. Silk weft ikat and gold thread (songket) weaving. Bangka. Early 20th century.\nCollection of the Asian Civilisations Museum.\nChinese Influences\nIt is difficult to pinpoint when Chinese traders and settlers first arrived in Sumatra. Chinese ceramics dating from the early centuries of the Common Era onwards have been retrieved from private collections. Archaeological evidence now shows that China traded directly with other countries as early as the 9th century. An Arab dhow that was salvaged at Belitung Island off southeast Sumatra carried a cargo of some 60,000 objects. These included mainly ceramics, as well as extremely rare gold and silver items thought to be official gifts for the courts in Iran (Persia).\nChinese presence in the region increased during the Ming dynasty (1368- 1644). Large expeditions by imperial envoy Zheng He cultivated tributary trade with Southern Ocean (Nanhai) countries during the 14th century. Migration from southern China increased particularly during the Colonial period when the Chinese ran businesses and worked for the administration as supervisors, tax collectors and tin miners.\nChinese settlement in coastal areas, especially Palembang, spawned successful alliances with the ruling elites. Inter-marriages resulted in the Peranakan, or ‘local born’ communities notable for their unique material culture that combines Chinese, local and European influences. Chinese lacquer-makers for example, were encouraged by the court to settle in Palembang where they became renowned. By 1813, one thousand Arabs and Chinese lived in Palembang. Their artistic traditions thrived as one of the court arts alongside ivory-carving, textiles and weapon-forging. Traditional symbols such as the phoenix and dragon (representing the Chinese empress and emperor, respectively), the fish (a symbol of fertility), the Chinese characters for happiness (fu), wealth (lu) and longevity (shou), and Buddhist emblems were in turn often adopted by other communities as decorative motifs.\nThe arrival of Islam\nIslam was established in Sumatra during the 13th century through trade with Muslim merchants and the founding of the first Islamic kingdom at Samudra-Pasai in Aceh. Most of the coastal sultanates derived their heritage from Malayu, the ancient seat of the Srivijaya kingdom. They became wealthy through international trade conducted at coastal ports and the courts became centres for cultural exchange with Mughal India, China, Europe, Iran and other countries in West Asia.\nDiverse cultural influences are evident in the different styles of Islamic architecture, textiles and the court arts patronised by the different sultanates. These items became royal regalia, the treasured heirlooms or pusaka that enhanced the legitimacy of rulers. They also included gifts from overseas which over time acquired legendary fame for their protective powers.\nForeign imports and skills from the Islamic World were highly valued. Silk and gold thread from India and China were used for royal garments, whilst Ottoman Turkish craftsmen sent to Aceh in the 16th century left a legacy of jewellery-making techniques. Diamonds and precious stones were imported from Persia and were brought from Kalimantan by Bugis traders. Keris-forging was introduced by the Javanese in the 13th century as well as by Bugis traders from South Sulawesi who travelled extensively and settled in the port areas of Sumatra.\nKeris. Gold, iron, wood, diamonds, rubies. Riau Lingga. Before 1991.\nCollection of National Museum of Indonesia.\nRegional Exchanges between the Coast and the Central Highlands\nRegional exchanges of cultural influence also took place between remote communities in the interior and coastal trading centres. Highland communities required metals for tools, jewellery and ritual objects, porcelain, salt and cloth. Coastal traders sought gold and natural products from the forests, and relied on the highlanders to transport these commodities via rivers or difficult land routes to the coast.\nThe Batak of Sumatra’s northern islands have ancient Hindu-Buddhist connections with early Indian settlers who moved into the interior from coastal regions. By the 19th century they had adopted Islam from Minangkabau and Aceh. However religious practices still combine ancestor worship and animistic rituals. These streams of influence are reflected in the motifs and designs of their jewellery, sculpture and other ritual objects.\nAlthough more remote, the islanders of Sumatra’s west coast such as the Nias community also traded with their neighbours. Gold was an important part of the jewellery tradition patronised and worn by the Nias nobility. The nobles distinguished themselves from commoners and slaves by commissioning gold jewellery, which is also seen in the carved adornments on wood figures of the ancestors.\nGold necklace. Sheet gold. North Nias. Late 19th or early 20th century.\nCollection of Mark Gordon.\nIdeas from the West\nEuropeans had known about Sumatra since Marco Polo’s visit to the island’s northern coast en route from China in the late 13th century. The Portuguese and Dutch arrived in the region during the 16th and 18th centuries respectively. However it was not until the 19th century that Dutch influence was consolidated in Sumatra. The 1824 the Anglo-Dutch Treaty signed between the Dutch and the British finally resolved conflicting interests in the region, including the role of Sir Stamford Raffles, who had been Governor of Bencoolen (1817 – 1823). One of the terms of the treaty resulted in the exchange of Sumatra for Dutch interests in the Malay Peninsula, including Singapore.\nEuropean trade for the most part was done with coastal communities, who sourced the much wanted pepper, gold, camphor and benzoin from the hinterlands. However, European influence also left its mark both on the courts as well as remote tribal communities. Christianity found its way to the Batak highlands from the 1860s onwards and Lake Toba, the ancestral homeland of the Batak, only first visited by Europeans in the late 19th century.\nLocal arts and crafts were also influenced by European interests. Objects collected during scientific expeditions and commissioned specially for large international exhibitions held in Europe during the late 19th century, included pieces made in European taste. The legacy of collecting was maintained through museums, the new cultural storehouses. The ‘colonial gaze’ or way of perceiving local cultures still underpins some museum displays today, and could be said to be yet another stream of cultural influence that fostered the rich heritage of Sumatra.\nFrom 30 July till 7 November 2010, the exhibition Sumatra: Isle of Fold at the Asian Civilisations Museum was the culmination of a collaborative project between the National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden, the Netherlands, and the National Museum of Indonesia with the support of provincial museums in Sumatra. The show travelled from Jakarta to Leiden before coming to Singapore. The Asian Civilisations Museum adapted the show to include more pieces from its own and private collections.\nReferences\nThe publication Sumatra. Crossroads of Cultures. (Eds.

Wooden ships would ride the wind down from the Straits of Malacca and pass by Singapore on to the South China Sea.\nLaurie & Whittle's New Chart of the Straits of Malacca, 1802.\nCollection of National Museum of Singapore.\nAccording to local legends, this was also the time that Sang Nila Utama, the Palembang Prince would arrive on the beaches of Telok Blangah and name the island ‘Singapura’.\nLiving off the same coast was the Orang Laut, literally ‘sea people’ in Malay. These sea nomads lived on long dwelling boats where Keppel Harbour is today. In the August of 1819, the first Resident of Singapore, William Farquhar, spotted the Orang Laut and saw in these waters a ‘New Harbour’.\nEntrance to New Harbour, Late 19th-early 20th century.\nCollection of National Museum of Singapore.\nCaptain Keppel\nWhile the deep and calm waters make for a natural harbour, it was not the safest. Due to the passing of cargo between China, India and Europe, many pirates have anchored themselves in the Straits. Chinese junks returned to China empty-handed, with only tales of ambush to take home. These tales tend to share similar narratives where fleets of hundreds encircled them, leaving them no choice but to surrender their goods to the pirates.\nLithographic print depicting pirate attack off Gilolo, 1848.\nCourtesy of National Museum of Singapore.\nHenry Keppel, the man who would have the honour of having the bay named after him, was no stranger to the pirates in these waters.\nHe first sailed to Singapore as a midshipman in 1832, but his life would become very much entwined with the island. He later returned to Singapore as the Captain of a British Royal Navy frigate, the Meander, as part of colonial efforts to clear the Straits of pirates. Armed with 44 cannons, the Meander and its massive sails was a clear threat to the pirates.\nAnd it was in May 1848 aboard the Meander that he discovered the deep water anchorage that made the waters of Singapore a natural harbour. His survey of the waters around Keppel Bay also formed the foundation of the plans for a new harbour of Singapore which was completed in 1886.\nThe harbour would be called ‘New Harbour’ until Keppel once again returned to Singapore in 1900, as a 92-year-old Admiral. In honour of his contribution and inseparable history with the harbour, acting Governor, Sir Alexander Swettenham, renamed the New Harbour, Keppel.\nEuropean officials, Jack Hardie, Admiral Sir Henry Keppel and Lady Clifford, 1900.\nCollection of National Museum of Singapore.\nKeppel Bay’s Docks\nIn the mid-20th century, if you were to hike up the winding road of Mount Faber, or Telok Blangah Hill as it was called during this time, you would be granted with a panoramic view of the southern shores. Large ships from all over the world would dot the shoreline, stopping by Keppel Harbour for repair and refuel. Ships looking to trade would lower their cargo into smaller bumboats which would find their way into the heart of Singapore River.\nView of the Telok Blangah public housing estate from Mount Faber, c. 1970s\nCollection of National Museum of Singapore.\nYou would also see some of Singapore’s oldest docks in their prime. The simply named Dock no. 1, built in 1859, was the first graving dock on the island. Once vessels were safely docked in place, water was pumped and drained out, leaving the hull exposed for repair and maintenance. Eight years later, Dock no. 2 was built.\nHowever, it was in the 1900s where the docks of Keppel Bay saw its golden age. In 1913, Singapore announced to the world the “largest dock East of the Suez”, the King’s Dock. The dock was the second largest in the world when it opened and took over four and a half years to construct, with the use of 203,000 tonnes of concrete.\nThe King's Dock in Singapore Postcard, c.1913.\nCollection of Singapore Philatelic Museum, Donated by Prof Cheah Jin Seng.\nBy the 1950s, Singapore had become one of the busiest ports in the region and to keep up with the overwhelming influx of ships, the Queen’s dock would be built. These four docks became the building blocks of Singapore’s post-independent economy as it sprinted towards the 20th century. Becoming a maritime hotspot, the bay bustled as workers at shipyard removed rust and barnacles while repainting large ships from across the world.\nKeppel Bay in the 21st Century\nToday, shipyard activity has been shifted to Tuas and these docks are no longer around. Keppel Bay has evolved from a busy shipyard to a luxurious hideaway at the fringe of the city centre. Luxury waterfront condominiums have been raised on the very grounds where seamen once stood and the docks of a past century have blended themselves into modern Singapore.The Caribbean at Keppel Bay stands on where Dock no. 2 used to be.\nAlthough the landscape has vastly shifted away from its previous nature at first glance, echoes of the dock’s place in history can still be seen in the water channels the condominium surrounds.\nHowever, its historical significance can also be seen in the condominiums raised in its place as well. With names such as Reflections, Corals and Caribbean, these buildings erected a tribute to Keppel Bay’s seafaring past.", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/the-story-of-keppel-bay/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/the-story-of-keppel-bay/1193105.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:23"},

In search of work and fortune, they took the plunge, boarding overcrowded junks for a perilous journey by sea.\nThe Chinese of early Singapore\nThe first bulk of arrivals in Singapore were mainly men who took on backbreaking work moving commodities and cargo from sea vessels to warehouses along the Singapore River.1 Known as coolies, these indentured labourers also worked in construction, agriculture, shipping, mining and rickshaw-pulling.2 As the port town of Singapore evolved, it received a regular influx of Chinese male immigrants. By and large, they came in three large waves between 1823 and 1927.\nA Chinese coolie, early-mid 20th century. Collection of National Museum of Singapore.\nUnfortunately, life was far from rosy. On top of desperately low wages, and miserable living conditions, the majority of them owed money to middle-men from clan associations and secret societies for arranging passage and work in Singapore. Clan associations were far more understanding of their plight, granting them lodging and protection, as well as aid via mutual assistance schemes. However, immigrants who cut deals with secret societies had to pay membership fees to cover costs in the event they fell ill or died here. As a means of escape, many gambled or smoked opium.\nAlong the way, the authorities in Singapore curbed the number of male immigrants to the colony and relaxed its policies towards female emigration to even out the gender ratio. Between 1934 and 1938, 200,000 women, affected by economic challenges and a slew of natural calamities in China, came to Singapore.\nHere, they found work in tin mines and rubber estates. Those who did general labour at construction sites around the island came to be known as samsui women. They primarily hailed from poor regions in China such as the Samsui district. Their work day usually started at 8am and they were largely tasked to dig soil. They carried earth, debris and building materials in buckets hung from shoulder poles. After work, they returned to tiny shared rooms in Chinatown.\nSamsui women working at a construction yard, 1938-1938.

By the end of the 1930s, Lê Phổ had travelled in both China and Europe, absorbing different cultural influences.

Although Ang Ku Kueh remains popular today, its significance in Chinese religious and cultural traditions is often overlooked.\nBy Cao Mingmin (NTU History Programme)\nAng Ku Kueh, which translates to “Red Tortoise Cake” in Hokkien, is a small oval-shaped Chinese treat consisting of a soft, sticky glutinous rice flour skin wrapped with a filling that is usually sweet. Its distinctive design that resembles a tortoise shell sets it apart from other treats. The kueh traces its history from southern Fujian, China – in Xiamen, Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, before making its way along migration routes across maritime Southeast Asia. Although Ang Ku Kueh remains popular today as a tea-time snack, its significance in Chinese religious and cultural traditions is often overlooked.\nThe making of Ang Ku Kueh starts from grinding and mixing the fillings. After that, strips of peanut fillings are divided equally to be wrapped in dough skin.\n\nEnsuring consistency throughout the process, including the separation of dough despite it being done by hand, is essential to making good Ang Ku Kueh.\n2021, Photographs taken by Cao Mingmin and Soe Wai Yan Linn.\n\nIn ancient China, tortoises were believed to be used as sacrifices to Chinese deities in seeking good fortune and longevity. However, as live tortoises were not easily sourced, turtle-shaped offerings were gradually developed as alternatives. As the name suggests, Ang Ku Kuehs are traditionally red in colour and have a chewy texture when eaten. In Chinese culture, the colour red here symbolises joy and happiness, while the tortoise shape signifies longevity, auspiciousness, wealth, and completeness.\nAfter grinding and dividing the fillings, the Ang Ku Kueh is moulded by hand.\n2021, Photographs taken by Cao Mingmin and Soe Wai Yan Linn.\n\nLastly, finely moulded Ang Ku Kueh will be steamed for approximately five minutes.\n2021, Photographs taken by Cao Mingmin and Soe Wai Yan Linn.\n\nThe various colours of Ang Ku Kueh indicate the different fillings in it. Medium-sized Ang Ku Kueh (Tiong Ku), Ang Ee, Money Kueh and Ka Ta Kueh are also a part of the assortment offered. \n2021, Courtesy of Ji Xiang Confectionery.\n\nFrom then on, Ang Ku Kuehs became an important kueh for offering on many occasions such as Chinese New Year, birthday of the Jade Emperor and in the celebrations of many other Chinese deities. By offering Ang Ku Kueh on ritual altars, devotees hope that the sweetness of the kueh will sweeten the mouths of the deities so that they will speak positively about the devotee in front of the Jade Emperor. During these religious festivals, Ang Ku Kuehs are usually bought in sets of 12 as it is considered auspicious. Another specially shaped Ang Ku Kueh that is offered on altar tables is the Money Kueh (钱糕), which is moulded from a design that depicts a string of copper coins.\nAccording to Kelvin Toh, the second-generation owner of Ji Xiang Confectionery, the different coloured kuehs indicate the different kinds of fillings. In the 1980s, Ji Xiang expanded its assortment of fillings as tastes diversified. Although there were many colours to choose from, red-coloured Ang Ku Kuehs of mung bean fillings are the traditional option in preparing for these occasions. In a year, the three busiest periods for Ji Xiang are the Jade Emperor’s birthday, Qing Ming Festival week, and the Hungry Ghost Festival month. On these important dates, only red-coloured Ang Ku Kuehs are made to speed up the process and meet demands.\nA pair of Ka Ta Kueh stacked in a box and ready for collection. The Ka Ta Kueh is shaped with a larger mould containing a clear design of a tortoise. Its size is approximately as big as an adult’s palm.\n2021, Photographs taken by Cao Mingmin and Soe Wai Yan Linn.\n\nIn addition to being religious offerings, Ang Ku Kuehs are also used in commemorating a newborn’s first month or the birthdays of elders. Eating the kueh and distributing them to relatives and friends during these occasions represent blessings for the child and longevity for the elder in the family. A notable social practice that has recently gained in popularity is stepping on a pair of big-sized , known as ‘Ka Ta Kueh’ (腳踏粿), traditionally seen when a baby turns one year old. The stepping on the Ka Ta Kueh, followed by stepping into a new pair of shoes symbolises a smooth journey in life, and the parents’ wishes that the child will be down-to-earth in his or her future endeavors. As Kelvin recalled, the practice became more popular in 2015 after a video made in commemoration of SG50 included scenes of “stepping on the Ka Ta Kueh”. Before 2015, Ka Ta Kuehs were only made a few times in a year. Now, Ji Xiang sells 20-30 pairs a week.\nWooden moulds for Money Kueh and Ka Ta Kueh are less common in the market today. Without these moulds, the traditions and practices that depended on such equipment may soon disappear.\n2021, Photographs taken by Cao Mingmin and Soe Wai Yan Linn.\n\nThe resurgence of this practice reflects how some traditions are still relevant and important within the Chinese community today. Stepping on the Ka Ta Kueh represents the enduring desire of parents to give their children a smooth start to life. Heritage businesses like Ji Xiang play an important role in keeping such social practices practicable. The significance of food heritage businesses lies not only in the food it sells, but also in its role of supporting our social practices and transmitting them to future generations. Greater awareness and understanding of these practices can therefore allow us to better appreciate our Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) that has since shaped our cultural and communal identity.\nAbout partner\n\nCao Mingmin (NTU History Programme)\nThe NTU History Programme strives to be a leading centre for researching and teaching interdisciplinary, Asian, and world/transnational history, while pushing innovative and immersive approaches to learning about and exploring Singapore's past and heritage.

Text by Joen Goh\nImages courtesy of Siong Leng Musical Association\nMuseSG Volume 9 Issue 2 - Apr to Jun 2016\nIn today’s fast-paced Singapore, it is hard to imagine ancient art forms like Nanyin (南音) and Liyuan (梨 園) opera taking root and finding a following among youths. Yet a Singaporean group in their 20s faithfully immerse themselves in this world of centuries-old musical instruments such as the dongxiao and sanxian, and slow, melodious singing in Southern Min dialect.\n“Nanyin is soothing and calming... and not something youngsters in Singapore would chance upon easily,” highlighted Joel Chia, one of the seven principal musicians in the Siong Leng Musical Association.\nSiong Leng Musical Association innovates with contemporary stage and musical arrangements of Nanyin, featuring traditional instruments with cross-cultural elements. Soul Journey – Cicada Zen (蝉。息) performed at Esplanade Theatre Studio, July 2012.\nThe original tone of instruments, tunes, lyrics and vocalisation are carefully preserved through scores and scripts, via a teacher- apprentice system. Watching a Nanyin performance today is similar to watching it in ancient China. Nanyin is often nicknamed the living fossil of ancient Chinese music and was listed as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO in 2009.\nGong Che Pu (工尺谱) scores showing unique Nanyin music notations from the book Nanyin – Music of the South, 2002.\nOriginal Nanyin composition and score by the late Teng Mah Seng: Singapore, Garden of the East (东方花园), 1982.\nNanyin and Liyuan Opera\nNanyin (“southern music” in Chinese) is a music genre which originated as court music during the Han Dynasty in China, more than two thousand years ago. As civil unrest over the years uprooted nobles and musicians from the Central Plains, Nanyin took root in the southern coastal area of Quanzhou in Fujian province.\nIn recent centuries, Nanyin followed the Chinese diaspora and spread to other shores. It reached Taiwan, Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore, where large groups of people of southern Chinese origin reside.\nNanyin remains close to its most traditional form, with music, lyrics and instrumental performance methods originating from Song and Tang Dynasty periods. Traditionally, Nanyin is performed by five musicians, with the vocalist seated in the middle and holding a clapper to set the beat. On the left, two musicians would play the dongxiao, a bamboo flute, and the erxian, a two-stringed fiddle. On the right of the vocalist, two other musicians would play the pipa, a Chinese lute, and the sanxian, whose sound is one octave lower than the pipa.\nAn ancient instrument that survived the times is the sibao, a percussion instrument consisting four pieces of bamboo that is unique to Nanyin,\nIllustration from Music of the South, 2004.\nWhat makes Nanyin unique is its close preservation of the art form. The dongxiao has retained its length of one foot eight inches in Nanyin, and while the modern-day pipa is constructed with a straight neck and held upright, Nanyin musicians use a crooked-necked pipa and hold it horizontally, like a guitar.\nA natural extension of Nanyin music, Liyuan opera’s origins can be traced to Quanzhou in Fujian, China. Unlike Teochew, Hokkien or Cantonese operas, Liyuan opera is a lesser-known variety of Chinese opera. It is commonly regarded as dramatised Nanyin. Preserving elements and essence of Tang and Song dynasties’ Nan opera, Liyuan opera is one of the most ancient surviving forms of Chinese opera.\nKeeping Traditional Art Alive\nSiong Leng Musical Association was founded in 1941. Today its mission is to preserve, develop and promote Nanyin and Liyuan Opera. What sets it apart from other traditional performing troupes is that most of the members in the Nanyin section are relatively young, in their 20s, providing an interesting contrast to this ancient art form.\nThe charm of the old, traditional music is precisely what draws its members together. However, being traditional is a double-edged sword for Nanyin and Liyuan Opera. While its quiet, old-world charm attracts some, others find it hard to endear themselves to these niche art forms.\nLin Shao Ling, Artistic Director of the association in 2016, recognises this challenge. Bold, new directions have been taken to bring Nanyin closer to the local audience. He has experimented with the use of musical instruments such as the Indian tabla and Malay kompang to create fusion performances. During the 2016 Huayi Festival at the Singapore Esplanade, he blended Nanyin and Xinyao songs.\nFrom left to right: Lin Shao Ling (Artistic Director), Teng Hong Hai (Chairman and son of the late Teng Mah Seng) and Wang Pheck Geok (Executive Director), 2013.\n“We want to create a multi-sensorial experience for our audience where they are enveloped in a whole artistic and cultural experience,” Lin shared. “That is why before our performances at the Esplanade, our audiences participate in a ritual of cleansing their hands with flowered water, listening to music and sipping tea amidst the scent of incense. These allow audience members to quieten their hearts and minds and be more ready to experience the soothing Zen-like ambience of Nanyin.”\nThe Mountain Spirit (礼魂) from Soul Journey Nine Songs (九歌。意象), performed at Esplanade Theatre, August 2015.\nThe God of the Xiang & The lady of the Xiang (湘君) 与 (湘夫人) from Soul Journey Nine Songs (九歌。意象), performed at Esplanade Theatre, August 2015.\nSoul Journey – Cicada Zen (蝉。息) , performed at Esplanade Theatre Studio, July 2012.\nTo reach a bigger audience and stay in touch with older Nanyin appreciators, Siong Leng keeps up an annual tradition of staging three open performances at the Thian Hock Keng Temple and a performance at Kusu Island. The team has also conducted workshops and demonstrations at public libraries, and continues to hold special workshops at its Bukit Pasoh premises.\nThe passion to keep the art form alive keeps Lin and his team going. This is a spirit they inherited from the late Teng Mah Seng, a Cultural Medallion recipient and former chairman of Siong Leng, who was a prolific Nanyin artist himself, composing more than a hundred Nanyin songs.\nIn 1983, Teng brought Siong Leng’s artists to compete overseas, walking away with a third prize in the Folk Solo category at the 37th Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod. It was the first time Nanyin had shone on the world stage. The feat was repeated in 2010 when Siong Leng took part in the same contest and clinched first prize.\nCelestina Wang, Executive Director of Siong Leng, was a protégé of the late Teng. She was tasked to run the association after his passing, and still looks to Teng’s legacy of foresight for guidance. “Mr Teng’s undying spirit in promoting Nanyin and Liyuan Opera continues to spur us to greater heights,” Wang said.\nCultivating the Next Generation of Artists\nFor Wang, her key challenge is to keep this cultural endeavour going. \"In five to ten years, we need a new generation of musicians and instructors to take the association further,\" she said.\nThe current hand-picked team of seven young local musicians, including Wang’s two sons, were selected to join the association during their teenage years. Since 1999, they have been journeying to China for intensive training with Nanyin masters. Back at Siong Leng, they are also taking up roles in administration and marketing even as they prepare for performances throughout the year.\nSiong Leng's seven - a new generation of young principal musicians being groomed to lead the association, 2013.\nOver the years, the seven have grown to become a close-knit group. “An intimate bond and a level of chemistry have built up between the seven of us after playing Nanyin together for so many years and training together,” said Cassandra Wang, principal musician and teacher of pipa and sanxian at Siong Leng.\nLooking Ahead\nLin strives to produce quality contemporary Nanyin presentations that Singaporeans will come to know and appreciate. He shared: “It is also my hope that Siong Leng can take Nanyin and Liyuan opera into the international scene. Even more pressing is the transmission of culture, which must happen together with the passing of the art to the next generation.”\nIt is this dedication to heritage and culture that makes Siong Leng Musical Association a treasured organisation in Singapore.\nWatch Siong Leng on Youtube:\nTo keep tabs on upcoming performances, check out their Facebook page!", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/nanyin-an-evolution-in-singapore/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/nanyin-an-evolution-in-singapore/nanyin-cover.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:25"},

{"id": "02BDAA9C-E5E1-4676-8BDA-BEDEE9C9C353", "title": "Heritage Volunteer: Tan Boon Piang", "dated": "unknown", "artist": "unknown", "role": "unknown", "department": "unknown", "medium": "unknown", "country": "china", "description": "Tan Boon Piang started volunteering as a docent while he was still working in the banking industry. Today, the retiree guides visitors at various museums. “When you are fast becoming a part of history, you better know more about history,” says volunteer docent Tan Boon Piang with a laugh. Jokes aside, this is why the 61-year-old decided to become a history buff some two decades ago.\nHe attributes his earlier lack of interest in history to not being inspired enough as a student at Catholic High School in the early 1970s. Plus, he was taught Southeast Asian history in Mandarin, and that made studying for the examinations extra tough. “Imagine the Indian and Thai names translated into Chinese! Oh my, what a mouthful!” he exclaims.\nWhen Boon Piang finally put his heart into studying history at the age of 40, he found out that few institutions would entertain a middle-aged man who just wanted to learn for the sake of learning. The exceptions were the Singapore Hainan Hwee Kuan, where he took a two-year course on China’s history, and the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM).\nIn 2006, while still working in the banking industry, Boon Piang answered the museum’s call for volunteers to guide a special exhibition, On the Nalanda Trail: Buddhism In India, China and Southeast Asia. This led him to be invited three years later to join the museum’s then newly-set up docent group. He could not have been happier to be given the opportunity to attend training courses by curators and academics. “Nowhere else would I get to study history for free!” Today, besides the ACM, the retiree also gives Mandarin tours at the Peranakan Museum, and the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall.\nAs the museums hold special exhibitions periodically, the delightful talks and training sessions never end for Boon Piang. They also expose him to topics he had not anticipated enjoying as much as he did.\nPop culture links\nBefore ACM’s Joseon Korea: Court Treasures and City Life exhibition, he had no inkling of Korean history, nor did he give his wife’s favourite Korean dramas a chance. But he ended up looking at these to find connections between history and pop culture when he had to do research for the exhibition. For example, he found a book about the popular Korean television series Jewel in the Palace, which was based on the Joseon Dynasty.\nOn his tours, Boon Piang brought along a Korean banknote and eagerly pointed out to visitors that the same king featured in the museum’s exhibition also appears on the banknote. This certainly worked with his wife who turned up for one of his exhibition tours.\n“You can’t go on and on about the artefacts,” he explains. “You have to tell them that ‘this was used by that character in the drama’ to attract their attention.”\nSupportive family\nBoth his son and wife have been supportive of his interest, but it has usually only been in the form of moral support.\nTheir daughter, on the other hand, has been to all of Boon Piang’s rehearsals. It was early on during such prep sessions that she pointed out his distracting mannerisms. For instance, she pointed out that she counted him saying “okay” 150 times in a single tour. She also advised him to condense the information he shared during a tour. “We are very close, so she dares to be brutally honest with me,” he says. Thanks to his volunteering, the father and daughter have had many opportunities to bond at the museum.\nBut, now that she has grown up, the 26-year-old is not interested in tagging along for overseas trips with her dad. For instance, inspired by the Joseon exhibition, Boon Piang planned a trip to Korea. “My daughter said, ‘I don’t want to go Korea with old people! Korea… must go with young people!’” He is still amused by her audacity.\nFortunately, Boon Piang has made some very good friends with the other museum volunteers. They often travel together, inspired by the exhibitions they work on. They have even initiated a project to translate ACM’s permanent exhibitions into Mandarin guide books. They have completed their third book, an effort which they laboured over for about six months.\nBoon Piang recalls when an ex-colleague bumped into him at the museum and was curious why he would do tours for free. “Many people in Singapore wouldn’t understand,” he says. The answer for Boon Piang is simple: his newfound love for history, and the camaraderie he has forged with other like-minded volunteers.\nBy Sheere Ng", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/heritage-volunteers-tan-boon-piang/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/heritage-volunteers/12-tan-boon-piang/tan-boon-piang-1_ca8a2223.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:25"},

Advertisement signboard for Tiger Balm Ten Thousand Golden Oil, Singapore, c. 1970s.\nCollection of National Museum of Singapore.\nThis is a metal signboard with an advertisement in Chinese for the Tiger Balm brand of pain-relieving ointment known as 'Ten Thousand Golden Oil'. The creators of Tiger Balm were brothers Aw Boon Haw and Aw Boon Par, who were born in Rangoon, Burma (today's Yangon, Myanmar). Boon Par took charge of production and developed other Tiger brand products, while Boon Haw packaged and marketed them. By 1918, the Aw family had become the richest family in Rangoon.\nIn 1932, Boon Haw built a villa for his second wife in Hong Kong. Behind the house, he built an elaborate garden that could be appreciated much like a Chinese landscape painting from the rooftop. Craftsmen well-versed in Chinese folklore were hired from Swatow, China, to build the garden. These same craftsmen then travelled to Singapore to build the Tiger Balm Gardens, or Haw Par Villa (named after the two brothers), in 1937.\nHaw Par Villa was built as a residence by Boon Haw for his younger brother, Boon Par. Though it was private property, part of the garden was opened to the public as Boon Haw wanted it to be an advertisement for Tiger Balm products. The gardens were a popular leisure destination till the 1980s and were known for their larger-than-life dioramas featuring scenes taken from Chinese religion, history and mythology. These dioramas were meant to educate visitors about fundamental Chinese values and beliefs, such as filial piety, resisting temptation and evil-doing, loyalty and fidelity, as well as community service, charity, and judgement in one's afterlife. Tiger Balm continues to be a popular local heritage brand today, and Haw Par Villa still stands in its original location in Pasir Panjang.\nThis is an extract from \"The Singapore Story through 60 objects\" written by Kennie Ting, Director, Asian Civilisations Museum and Peranakan Museum & Group Director of Museums, National Heritage Board.

Sadly, all my students chose to travel to the future. Looks like I am the only one who wants to go back to the Qing dynasty!” laughs Kwen Khee.\nHer love affair with history dates back to her childhood. Thinking back, she attributes this passion to her history teacher in secondary school.\n“She’ll talk history for two straight periods without looking at the book. I remember thinking to myself, Wow, she knows everything by heart. It was really admirable and inspiring,” she recalls with a smile. Kwen Khee seems to have imbued her own storytelling with the same qualities.\nLife-long history lessons\nKwen Khee’s relationship with SYSNMH began quite by chance, with an invitation to a friend’s tour six years ago. “I fell in love with the place,” she sighs fondly. “It is small and humble, but its stories are endless and fascinating.”\n“I wish more Singaporeans knew their history. This particular history is not (yet) in our textbooks; people do not realise the importance of Dr Sun Yat Sen in our own Singapore story,” says Kwen Khee about the exhibits.\nIndeed, many Singaporeans do not know of Dr Sun’s revolutionary ideas and crucial role in Singapore’s intellectual development. According to Kwen Khee, even tourists from Taiwan and China have been surprised by what they learned at SYSNMH.\n“They are always very grateful to learn. In China especially, their story is told very differently back home,” Kwen Khee explains. “This part of history is missing in the Chinese narrative. Some Chinese tourists even told me –– gosh, we do not know our own history!”\nA storyteller at heart\nA gentle and unassuming individual, Kwen Khee says she is not like other docents. Shyly, she confides that she has had a lifelong fear of public speaking. This is why she teaches private tuition instead of in public schools, she adds. One-to-one sessions with students are not as daunting as facing a whole crowd.\nWhy sign up to be a docent, then, and have to speak to large tour groups all the time? “Sharing stories is very rewarding. I like to tell stories,” she explains.\nKwen Khee is driven by her passion to educate, and pass important knowledge on to others. Besides, being a docent has helped her to overcome her phobia, she adds. Today, public speaking is no longer as difficult for her as it used to be.\n“I use my own success story to encourage others who are afraid of public speaking too,” Kwen Khee shares candidly. “I tell them, just try. It might just help you get over your fears.”\nTeachers’ knowhow helps\nAt SYSNMH, there is no one primary or main demographic. Visitors range from primary school students to tourists from all over the world, or senior citizens from various Voluntary Welfare Organisations.\nBeing a teacher, Kwen Khee is able to sensitively codeswitch and pitch appropriately to her crowd. As her students range from primary school all the way to junior college, she is used to varying her use of language –– speaking more clearly and simply to the little ones, and allowing more complexity and nuance to the older ones.\nFurthermore, teaching has made Ms Ho very good at reading her audience; she is very sensitive to their needs and reactions. “It’s all in the eyes,” she chuckles. “From their eyes you can tell who is confused, who is engaged, who is dreaming!”\nAll these crucial skills allow Kwen Khee to simplify or complicate her language and content wherever needed. This helps her to tailor her speech to many diverse groups of listeners, keeping them happy and interested throughout the tour.\nGrowing as a docent\nBecoming a tour guide at SYSNMH was not easy for Kwen Khee. “We did our own independent research, and wrote our own 5,000-word script,” she says.\nShe has been attached exclusively to the museum since she began giving tours in 2013. Selfless and dedicated, Kwen Khee goes above and beyond her tour guide duties. She also assists the memorial hall in arranging and scheduling special tours, as well as manages larger crowds by organising them into smaller groups before tours begin. This way, Kwen Khee helps to ensure that everything runs without a hitch.\nIt is clear to see that Kwen Khee’s passion and dedication to sharing knowledge permeates her tours. Truly, SYSNMH visitors are all the better for it!\nBy Chew Wei Shan and Nurudin Sadali", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/Ho-Kwen-Khee-Heritage-Volunteer/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/nhb-volunteers-articles/docent-kwen-khee/docent-kwen-khee.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:26"},

Somaskanda, Shiva with Parvati and their son Skanda, Tamil Nadu, south India, Chola period, c. 1200, bronze.\nCollection of Asian Civilisations Museum.\nThe Cholas were a powerful dynasty that ruled parts of India from the 3rd century BCE to the 13th century CE. At their zenith, they ruled all of southern India and Sri Lanka. From the earliest centuries CE, southern India had traded with the Mediterranean world, and during the Chola dynasty, with China and Southeast Asia. It was a prosperous period, and extensive patronage resulted in the building of many temples. Among the most remarkable works of art are bronze temple sculptures made for processions.\nDarshan — to see and be seen by the deity - is one of the fundamental principles of Hindu worship. Originally, this could only happen within the inner sanctum of a temple, where many devotees of low position were excluded. Around the 6th century, a new concept emerged: images of deities were paraded outside the temple during festivals, where they could be seen by all. This led to the production of many portable bronze sculptures.\nThis sculpture of a seated Shiva and his consort Parvati (also known as Uma) accompanied by their infant son Skanda is visualised in the Tamil Hindu tradition as a representation of an ideal divine 'family'. Somaskanda, means \"with Uma and Skanda\", and is the most important image of Shiva in southern India after the linga, his abstract form. This is because the faithful can obtain individual blessings from Shiva when he is in the presence of Uma. In Indian art, this image only appears in the south. This exquisite sculpture was made for festival processions, hence the loops on the base to attach poles for carrying it. The manner in which the pedestals fit into each other is unusual as the convention is a single pedestal for the trio.\nThis is an extract from \"The Singapore Story through 60 objects\" written by Kennie Ting, Director, Asian Civilisations Museum and Peranakan Museum & Group Director of Museums, National Heritage Board.

TL;DR\nDongnan Zheng (Dayneson), a former sound technician at the 1990s Haw Par Villa Dragon World theme park, ignited our interest and imagination and gave us a window into a long-gone world held together by an ensemble of dancers, actors, painters, and other crew members, through his soundscape of memories.\nText by Kitson Yap, Lee Si Ping, Nurfalah Sha'aban & Joshua Ong (Singapore Heritage Society)\nDongnan Zheng (Dayneson) was a sound technician at Haw Par Villa from 1991 to 1994. In this time, Haw Par Villa was a key tourist attraction, Dragon World theme park, one of the most popular tourists attractions in Singapore in the 90s. It was such a sensation that 20,000 advance tickets were sold before its opening day. Dragon World was impressive in scale: it could hold a capacity of 12,000 visitors on each day.\n\"Eager beavers snapped up 20,000 tickets for the new Haw Par Villa theme park even before the park made any announcement.\n- The New Paper, 18 September 1990\"\nDuring his time there, Dongnan forged many good, long-standing friendships. He even created a photo montage to help his Dragon World buddies reminisce about the good ol' days. We chanced upon his montage on YouTube and got curious about what it was like to work at Dragon World. We asked him for an interview and he agreed, jovially taking us on a site walkthrough and a journey down memory lane one evening on 18 February 2022.\nStill from photo montage video produced by Dongnan for Dragon World's 30th anniversary celebration virtual gathering, 2020 (Image Credit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4syewadER50&ab_channel=dayneson via Dongnan Zheng)\nOur day with Dongnan started with music. The sound technician had brought along a small, portable speaker in his satchel, treating us to a whimsical playlist of music composed by the Cultural Medallion recipient, the late Iskandar Ismail. He explained to us that this was the music for the dramatic daily opening ceremony that would happen at Dragon World at the start of each working day, which Dongnan had helped to choreograph. Dongnan's workday used to start at 8am. His first duty was to turn on the music for the park's opening ceremony via a control room. Then, at 8.30am, an ensemble of performers dressed like celestial warriors would station themselves at the entrance, under the park's main signboard. At 9am, the celestial warriors actors would sound a gong. Staff on standby would then swing open the park's gates to welcome the day's eager visitors. \nDongnan brings us around his former workplace, where he is standing in the former Four Seasons Theatre, 2022 (Image Credit: Nurfalah Sha'aban)\n'Celestial Warriors' positioned at the entrance, ready to hit the gong beside the 'Haw Par Villa' sign, 1991 (Image Credit: Dongnan Zheng)\nAfter the opening ceremony, Dongnan would go to the South China Sea Amphitheatre 30mins before the first scheduled show at 10am. Dongnan would be manning the control room, setting up the sound effects keyboard and checking on the music cassette tapes needed for the show. Through these experiences in this amphitheatre, he honed the craft of executing choreographed, dramatic sound work. A fire's crackling, the burst of a thunderstorm, the woosh of an arrow - these were the sounds that Dongnan played on cue, to generate an electrifying experience that would leave a mark on the audience. On stage, performers were busy wow-ing the audience with acrobatics, mascot performances, Chinese opera, and traditional Chinese music. These performances at the 2,000-seat amphitheatre were part of the tourist attraction offering at Dragon World.\nDongnan inside the control room of the South China Sea Amphitheatre, where he coordinated sound effects for performances, 1991 (Image Credit: Dongnan Zheng)\nView from South China Sea Amphitheatre control room. For Dongnan, the control room boasted beautiful sea views from Pasir Panjang too, 1991 (Image Credit: Dongnan Zheng)\nAfter completing work at the amphitheatre, Dongnan would take a walk around Haw Par Villa where he lapped up the sometimes off-the-cuff performances at Dragon World's five other theatres. One of his favourites was the Four Seasons Theatre located at the site of the Aw brothers' former mansion (if you're visiting today it is the area with the red terrazzo steps). Performances at the Four Season Theatre typically involved a skit with four characters dressed as the Four Seasons, but visitors were sometimes also given costumes and invited to join the actors. Dongnan's day was filled with other enjoyable and memorable moments including break time where he'd retire to a rehearsal room at the back of Haw Par Villa, where Zehnder Road is. Here, he fondly recalled playing video games with cast member Gurmit Singh, and growing deep ties with the rest of the Dragon World community.\nThe comedian Kumar (left) performs as Snow White in \"Snow White But Not So White\" - another performance that Dongnan enjoyed, 1992 (Image Credit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Med1-Ay3VU&ab_channel=dayneson via Dongnan Zheng)\nSometimes, like in the movie 'Night at the Museum', after the park shuts its gates to the visitors at 6pm, the Dragon World cast members would stay behind to revel in after-hour parties, where they would unwind and enjoy themselves after a long day. According to Dongnan, \"We work[ed] hard. We play[ed] hard.\" Apart from music concerts, there were also memorable themed parties.\nDongnan (centre) with mascots Lee Ming (right) and Da Long (left). Cast members often visited the park even during their off-days, 1991 (Image Credit: Dongnan Zheng)\nCast members enthusiastically dressed in colourful grabs for after-hour parties, like this pirate's night, 1993 (Image Credit: Dongnan Zheng)\nDongnan worked at Dragon World from 1991 to 1994. Haw Par Villa continues to have a special place in the memories of Dongnan and numerous other former cast members. They have often met to reminisce about those days. One way they continue to relive the past is via the music of the late Iskandar Ismail which was salvaged by Dongnan. It became a tradition for them to play this music during gatherings. \nDongnan himself returns to Haw Par Villa from time to time. Each time he does so, he brings along a portable speaker to play the soundtrack of Dragon World, matching each tune to their former performance venue. Although the theme park no longer exists, he is relieved that Haw Par Villa still stand, for it represents a season in his life where he forged close relationships with those he worked, danced, joked, and sang with. \"[If they] tear down this place, I will be sad,\" Dongnan said.\nCast member reunions often comprise visits to Haw Par Villa. They even met during the pandemic in 2020 via Zoom, 2020 (Image Credit: Dongnan Zheng)\nGurmit & Kumar are just two of the famous names that have passed through Dragon World, 1991 (Image Credit: Dongnan Zheng)\nAbout Partner\nKitson Yap, Lee Si Ping, Nurfalah Sha'aban and Joshua Ong are a group of students from various universities and disciplines that have an interest in helping others to appreciate Haw Par Villa after interning at Singapore Heritage Society (SHS). During the stint, they worked on a social media campaign for Haw Par Villa on SHS' Instagram and Facebook, #myhawparvilla, in the hopes of increasing public awareness of the site's heritage. After which, they had decided to continue our efforts in making Haw Par Villa more accessible so that others could appreciate Haw Par Villa.", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/The-Sights-and-Sounds-of-Dragon-World/Story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/SHF-2022-Articles/The-Sights-and-Sounds-of-Dragon-World/0-The-Sights--Sounds-of-Dragon-World.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:27"},

ICH fosters a sense of identity amongst the different communities and contributes to the vibrancy of Singapore’s multicultural heritage. It is therefore important that we document and safeguard our ICH for future generations.\nSingapore Town Plan by Lieutenant Philip Jackson, which shows how downtown Singapore was divided into ethnic districts based on Raffles’s instructions,\n1828\nCourtesy of National Museum of Singapore, National Heritage Board\nKreta Ayer: Cultural Heartland of Chinatown\nThe boundaries of present-day Chinatown were established in 1822 and its origin can be attributed to Sir Stamford Raffles. This is because Raffles organised the town of Singapore according to ethnicity as a way of preserving communal harmony, as well as facilitating trade by locating ethnic groups involved in commerce closer to the port. The historic district of Chinatown today consists of four sub-districts: Telok Ayer, Kreta Ayer, Tanjong Pagar and Bukit Pasoh.\nAmong the four sub-districts, Kreta Ayer Road and its neighbouring streets formed the commercial heart of Chinatown. The name “Kreta Ayer” means “water cart” in Malay, which refers to the bullock and ox carts that plied Kreta Ayer Road in the mid-1800s. These carts were used to distribute water from wells located in Ann Siang Hill.\nThe early immigrants of Kreta Ayer, who were predominantly Cantonese, brought with them traditional and cultural traits from their hometowns in China. Kreta Ayer soon became a cultural heartland known for its concentration of teahouses and opera theatres. It was also home to other traditional arts such as nanyin music, lion dance and wushu, which are examples of ICH that are still practised in Chinatown today.\nBullock carts and rickshaws along New Bridge Road, undated\nCourtesy of National Museum of Singapore, National Heritage Board\nChinese Opera\nChinese opera is a performing art form rooted in Chinese tradition and staged with stylised actions and elaborate costumes. Music, acting, martial arts and acrobatics are key features across various genres of Chinese opera. Opera performances often draw upon Chinese folklore, history or literature, and showcase aspects of Chinese culture, tradition and philosophy.\nKnown locally as “wayang” in Malay, Chinese opera was the most popular form of local live entertainment for more than a century in Singapore. Introduced by Chinese migrants in the 19th century, it was often performed at religious festivities in honour of deities such as Ma Zu (goddess and protector of seafarers), Guan Yin (goddess of mercy) and Guan Di (god of war and protector of tradesmen). Presented on makeshift stages, opera performances were often sponsored by temples and clans, and staged for free public viewing.\nBetween the late 1800s and 1930s, the Chinese opera scene in Singapore was thriving and the 1881 census recorded a total of 240 Chinese opera performers. In fact, Chinese opera became so popular here during its heyday that Singapore was known as the “second homeland of Cantonese opera” outside of Hong Kong and China!\nA Chinese opera stage near the former Ellenborough Market, 1890s\nCourtesy of the National Museum of Singapore, National Heritage Board\nA Chinese street opera performance at Kreta Ayer Road, 1950s\nCourtesy of the National Museum of Singapore, National Heritage Board\nA Chinese street opera performance, 1998\nPaul Piollet Collection, courtesy of National Heritage Board\nA set of photographs showing opera fans at Kreta Ayer People’s Theatre, 1975\nReplicas of Joanna Wong’s collection\nThese photographs were taken after a performance by the famous Hong Kong Chor Fung Ming Cantonese Opera Troupe at Kreta Ayer People’s Theatre in 1975. As evidence of the popularity of Chinese opera during that time, throngs of enthusiastic fans could be seen surrounding the performers as they leave the theatre.\nOpera Houses\nAs the popularity of Chinese opera increased, opera houses that could accommodate hundreds of patrons were built in Chinatown to stage shows on a daily basis. Established in 1887 along Smith Street, Lai Chun Yuen was the first opera house dedicated to Cantonese opera and staged performances twice a day. Other notable opera houses include Heng Seng Peng and Heng Wai Sun at Wayang Street (today’s Eu Tong Sen Street).\nAnother well-known venue is Tien Yien Moi Toi Theatre (former Majestic Theatre), built in 1927 by tycoon Eu Tong Sen, reportedly for his wife who was an avid opera fan. In the early years of its inception, it attracted glamorous opera stars from China before it was converted into a cinema in 1938.\nIn the early 20th century, Chinese teahouses were also popular venues for opera performances. The teahouse at Great Southern Hotel, colloquially known as Nam Tin, drew crowds with regular qingchang (Mandarin for “pure singing”) performances which involve solo or group renditions of operatic excerpts accompanied by a small group of musicians.\nA teahouse at the junction of Trengganu and Smith Street, 1890s\nCourtesy of the National Museum of Singapore, National Heritage Board\nTien Yien Moi Toi (former Majestic Theatre) on the left and Nam Tin teahouse on the right, 1950s\nBels Collection, courtesy of National Archives of Singapore\n>Eu Tong Sen Street with Heng Seng Peng and Heng Wai Sun opera theatres in the background, c. 1920\nCourtesy of the National Museum of Singapore, National Heritage Board\nA portrait photograph of local opera actress Phan Wait Hong, 1930\nPhan Wait Hong Collection, courtesy of National Archives of Singapore\nElements of Chinese Opera\nCostumes\nIn general, Chinese opera costumes can be divided into five categories, namely mang (four-clawed dragon robe), pei (informal robe for the elite), kao (armour), zhe (robe for commoners) and yi, (other costumes).\nThe costumes help audiences identify the role of each character, whose social standing is reflected in the costumes. Costumes with more elaborate designs are typically worn by important and powerful figures while simpler ones are reserved for those with a low status. Most costumes make reference to clothing from historical periods such as the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644), which was the golden era of Chinese opera.\nOpera actors in kao (armour) costumes, undated\nCourtesy of Dr Chua Ee Kiam\nMusic\nMusic in Chinese opera can be divided into two categories: wen (Mandarin for “civil”) and wu (Mandarin for “military”). Wen music comprises string and wind instruments that accompany characters such as scholars and court ladies. Wu music uses percussion instruments in dramatic moments such as hand-to-hand combat and battle scenes.\nCharacters\nCharacters in a Chinese opera are generally classified into four types: dan (female characters); sheng (male characters); jing (male characters with painted faces); and chou (clown). Each character type has its own distinct make-up, costume and performance style. Typically, a performer would specialise in a specific role and refine his or her portrayal of the character over time.\nAn opera actor (centre) in a chou (clown) role, 2012\nCourtesy of Dr Yam Tim Wing\nAn opera actress in a dan (female) role, 2015\nCourtesy of Dr Chua Ee Kiam\nAn opera actor in a sheng (male) role, 2017\nCourtesy of Dr Chua Ee Kiam\nA make-up set containing black, white and rouge colours, a powder puff and make-up brushes\nCourtesy of National Heritage Board\nA Cantonese opera male and female kao (armour) costume\nCourtesy of National Heritage Board\nThis is a typical costume worn by an actor playing a male general during battle scenes in a Chinese opera performance. The body of the costume is usually covered in scale-like motifs, which are modelled after ancient Chinese amour. The four triangular flags attached to the back of the costume are a reference to pennants of command awarded to generals in the past. They also symbolise preparedness for war, and heightens the costume’s dramatic effect. The flags can be removed after the battle scene is completed.\nKao is also worn by an actor playing a female general during battle scenes in a Chinese opera performance. Compared to the male general’s costume, female kao costumes tend to incorporate a shoulder cape and more feminine touches such as tassels.\nLocal Dialect Forms of Chinese Opera\nCantonese opera, Hokkien opera and Teochew opera were and remain the three most common regional forms of opera staged in Singapore. The different genres of opera could be found in different quarters: Cantonese opera was predominantly performed in Kreta Ayer, Hokkien opera in the vicinity of Nankin Street and Hokien Street, and Teochew opera around Merchant Road and New Market Road.\nCantonese Opera\nCantonese opera (yueju) is performed in the Cantonese dialect and one of its key characteristics lies in its elaborately embroidered costumes that showcase strong regional influence from Guangdong. The costumes are usually made of silk and satin, and dyed in bright colours that have symbolic meanings. For example, yellow represents respectability, red embodies integrity, and black denotes forthrightness.\nPerformers also don simple but striking make-up, paired with a bright red lipstick. While most opera genres feature the common “white and red face”, Cantonese opera tends to emphasise the red highlights around the eyes and on the cheeks, as well as a sharp contouring of the nose.\nA Cantonese opera actress adjusting her headgear, 2016\nCourtesy of Dr Chua Ee Kiam\nA Cantonese opera performance at Pagoda Street, 1981\nCourtesy of Quek Tiong Swee\nChat Thye Poh’s notebook and membership pass for Part Woh Wui Koon (Cantonese Opera Artistes Guild)\nOn loan from Cindy Chat\nTeochew Opera\nTeochew opera (chaoju) is performed in the Teochew dialect and involves colourful costumes and stylised movements. Although the costumes are vibrant and detailed, they are usually not as ornate as their Cantonese counterparts. This genre is also known for its variety of clown (chou) characters, and it is common to see multiple clown characters appearing in a single Teochew opera performance.\nTeochew opera is also closely associated with street performances, where a temporary stage is constructed in open areas. These performances are conducted by professional troupes, such as Sing Yong Hoe Heng Teochew Wayang. The oldest of these troupes is Lao Sai Tao Yuan Teochew Opera Troupe, which was established in the 1850s and is the oldest surviving troupe in Singapore.\nAn opera performance by Lao Sai Tao Yuan Teochew Opera Troupe, 1965\nMinistry of Information and the Arts Collection, Courtesy of National Archives of Singapore\nHokkien Opera\nHokkien opera (in the form of minju, gezaixi, gaojiaxi, liyuanxi, xiangju) is performed in the Hokkien dialects, and is usually based on folk tales from the Fujian province in China. As most performances are narrated using colloquial language, Hokkien opera is one of the most popular genres of Chinese opera. Folk music (xiaodiao) is also used in performances and such music often possesses a catchy melody, which adds to the genre’s popularity.\nLike Teochew opera, Hokkien opera is also associated with street performances. However, unlike its Teochew and Cantonese counterparts, Hokkien opera is known for its improvisation and, in more contemporary times, for using modern musical instruments. One of the most prominent professional Hokkien groups was Sin Sai Hong Hokkien Wayang, which had a history dating back to 1910.\nA Hokkien opera performance at Tan Kong Tian Temple, 2017Courtesy of Dr Lim Kian Chong\nMemories of Chinese Opera\n“I became interested in Cantonese opera as a child because I watched opera performances regularly with my aunt. I used to listen to Cantonese operas from my father’s collection of vinyl records and attended singing classes at a clan association. While I never had formal Chinese lessons, I learned to read and write the language on my own by singing and reading opera lyrics.\nI was so excited to make my debut as lead actress for Madam White Snake in 1968. I wanted to preserve Cantonese opera, so I set up Chinese Theatre Circle in 1981 with my husband Leslie. We have performed all over the world! I even came up with new ideas like singing opera in English and having English subtitles to help more people appreciate opera. The past 60 years have not been easy, but opera is something I will never give up. My focus now is on nurturing young talent and directing shows.”\n– Joanna Wong, whose efforts and achievements in reviving Cantonese opera earned her the prestigious Cultural Medallion in 1981\nWitness statement of 'Sook Ching' Massacre. (c. May 1946. Collection of National Museum of Singapore\n“My father Chat Thye Poh left China in his teens and first settled in Malaysia, where he trained as an opera apprentice under his mentor. In 1951, he moved to Singapore and made Chinatown his home. He told me that he paid weekly visits to Part Woh Wui Koon (Cantonese Opera Artistes Guild) in Keong Saik Road to seek out potential job opportunities with opera troupe owners.\n\nOver the years, he became a popular Cantonese opera actor skilled in both civilian and military-type roles. He used to travel all over Singapore and Malaysia for work, and performed at different makeshift venues across Chinatown, such as Pagoda Street, Mosque Street and Banda Hill.”\n–- Cindy Chat, whose father was a popular Cantonese opera actor in Chinatown in the 1950s and 60s\nChinese Puppet Theatre\nChinese puppet theatre arrived in Singapore from southern China in the late 1800s to early 1900s. Like Chinese opera, Chinese puppet theatre was another form of popular entertainment for the masses. Puppet shows were usually held on a temporary stage, often along the streets or within a temple compound. Occasionally, troupes were also hired to perform for private events such as birthdays or weddings.\nChinese opera and Chinese puppet theatre are closely associated. Like Chinese opera, Chinese puppetry is linked to the Buddhist-Taoist faith and is usually staged to celebrate the feast days of deities. Performers of Chinese puppet theatre were sometimes former opera actors who could employ their singing skills for the puppets’ voices. However, these former opera actors would still need to master the techniques necessary to manoeuver the puppets.\nPuppet shows continue to entertain both locals and foreign visitors around Chinatown today, mostly during festive or religious occasions. In an attempt to attract younger audiences, puppet troupes such as Sin Hoe Ping incorporate modern puppets as well as a variety of puppets, such as string puppets and glove puppets, in the same play.\nChildren watching a Chinese puppet show at Cecil Street, 1951\nThe Straits Times © Singapore Press Holdings. Reprinted with Permission\nThe backstage of the string puppet theatre set up at Thian Hock Keng temple, 2017\nCourtesy of Quek Tiong Swee\nCommon Types of Puppetry in Singapore\nIn Singapore, the common genres of Chinese puppetry include Hokkien glove puppetry, Teochew iron-stick puppetry, Hainanese rod puppetry and Henghua string puppetry.\nThe Hokkien glove puppet is between 25 to 35cm in length. The puppeteer controls the puppet’s movements with his hand and fingers, which are fully inserted into the body of the puppet. Only the arms of the puppeteer are exposed on stage, as he controls his puppet from beneath the stage.\nThe Teochew iron-stick puppet is approximately 35cm in length. Three iron sticks are connected to the puppet: one to support the puppet head made of clay or papier-mâché and the other two for the puppeteer to manoeuver during a performance.\nThe Hainanese rod puppet measures between 60 to 70cm in length. It has a middle rod which controls the head and two thinner rods at the base for manoeuvring its movements.\nThe Henghua string puppet is at least 80cm in length and has twelve strings. Additional strings can be attached to perform the trickier and more elaborate movements. At the peak of its popularity in the 1950s, the Henghua genre dominated the Chinese puppetry art scene in Singapore.\nWatch: Puppetry Video — An extract from the documentary film Performance of the Gods by Dr Caroline Chia.

Completed in 2016, this documentary film was produced as part of her research project.\nNanyin, Music of the South\nNanyin, literally meaning “music of the south” in Mandarin, is a musical art form that is performed using vocals and a specific set of wind, string and percussion instruments. Its origin can be traced to Tang dynasty court music, as well as cultural traditions from the Song, Yuan and Ming periods. Nanyin flourished during the Ming and Qing periods in Fujian province, from where the art form was later brought to Singapore by Chinese immigrants in the 1800s.\nNanyin grew in popularity among Singapore’s early Chinese settlers as its familiar sounds served as an emotional link to their homeland. The cultural art form is usually played alongside Chinese opera performances, or during events such as temple festivals or private celebrations. Nanyin musicians also formed societies based on dialect or kinship, which enabled them to connect with kinsmen from the same hometown.\nToday, nanyin is still performed in temples such as Thian Hock Keng, one of Singapore’s oldest Hokkien temples. In fact, Thian Hock Keng continues to uphold an age-old tradition of hosting nanyin performances in honour of the deity Guan Yin. The cultural art form is also practised by various musical groups such as Siong Leng Musical Association.\nSiong Leng Musical Association, 1947\nMinistry of Information and the Arts Collection, courtesy of National Archives of Singapore\nA nanyin performance at Thian Hock Keng temple, 2018\nCourtesy of Quek Tiong Swee\nForms of Nanyin\nFujian Nanyin\nThe Fujian genre of nanyin uses the Hokkien dialect of Fujian province and instrumental music. It is transmitted through a long tradition of music that is expressed in three forms: instrumental suites; suites with instrumental and vocal parts; and ballads accompanied by an ensemble. Nanyin is integral to the cultural identity of Fujian province and is commonly described as the region’s “mother music” (muyue).\nA nanyin performance is typically led by a solo vocalist who is accompanied by instruments such as pipa (four-stringed lute), dongxiao (bamboo flute), sanxian (three-stringed lute) and erxian (two-stringed bowed fiddle) as well as percussion instruments such as ban (wooden clappers to maintain rhythm). Traditionally, the pipa serves as the leading instrument and is used to provide the main melody.\nMember of Siong Leng Musical Association playing the erxian, 1947\nMinistry of Information and the Arts Collection, courtesy of National Archives of Singapore\nMember of Siong Leng Musical Association playing the pipa, 1947\nMinistry of Information and the Arts Collection, courtesy of National Archives of Singapore\nMember of Siong Leng Musical Association playing the sanxian, 1947\nMinistry of Information and the Arts Collection, courtesy of National Archives of Singapore\nCantonese Naam-Yam\nCantonese nanyin, known as naam-yam in Cantonese, differs from Fujian nanyin in language, musical style, repertoire and instruments used. The genre of naam-yam comprises narrative singing where stories are vocalised through song. Naam-yam is usually performed using guzheng (Chinese zither), yehu (bowed lute made of coconut shell) or yangqin (hammered dulcimer), as well as ban. The lyrics of naam-yam are often melancholic and sombre, and revolve around the themes of heartbreak and struggle.\nNaam-yam was once a popular form of entertainment among the Cantonese community in Kreta Ayer before the 1950s. Today, although naam-yam is rarely performed in its traditional form, some of its singing techniques have been adopted in Cantonese opera performances.\nThe musical instruments and score book on display were used by the Siong Leng Musical Association for their nanyin performances. Founded in 1941, Siong Leng is widely recognised for its contributions in promoting and preserving traditional nanyin music. Under former chairman Teng Mah Seng’s leadership, the association won third prize in the folk solo category at the 37th Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod.\nPipa\nThis pipa belonged to Wang Yue Hua, the late wife of the late Teng Mah Seng, and co-founder of Siong Leng Musical Association. The four-stringed pipa is a prominent instrument in nanyin.\nChinese Calligraphy\nCalligraphy was once an essential part of everyday life for the Chinese community as it served as the primary form of written communication. It was used in the writing of personal letters, advertisements, plaques and even road signs. Chinese calligraphy also serves as a means of expression and self-cultivation employed by poets, artists and intellectuals in their artistic and literary endeavours.\nThe tradition of Chinese calligraphy was brought to Singapore by Chinese immigrants. In the early 1900s, calligraphy was taught in Chinese-language schools such as Tuan Mong High School and Chung Cheng High School. In the 1900s, there was also a market for calligraphy signboards and such signboards can still be found hanging above the entrances of shops, temples and cultural associations in Chinatown.\nToday, Chinese calligraphy is still appreciated for its timeless artistic and cultural values. While it is not as widely practiced as before, calligraphy is still taught in some schools as well as at community centres and cultural institutions. Calligraphy competitions, such as the annual National Calligraphy Hui Chun Competition, are organised regularly, and calligraphic paintings are also displayed in museums and exhibitions.\nA Chinese calligraphy stall in Chinatown, 1981.\nCourtesy of Quek Tiong Swee.\nA Chinese calligrapher writing a Confucian saying on red rice paper, 1980s.\nCourtesy of the National Museum of Singapore, National Heritage Board.\nFirst Generation Calligraphers in Singapore\nTan Heng Fu (1870-1953)\nTan Heng Fu was a former Qing dynasty scholar who migrated to Singapore from Xinhui district in Guangdong, China when he was 62 years old. Tan was a skilled calligrapher and the artist behind the five Chinese characters on the façade of Majestic Theatre. The characters bear the building’s old place name of Tien Yien Dai Moh Toi, when it housed a Chinese opera theatre.\nWu Wei Ruo (1900-1980)\nWu Wei Ruo was a native of Dabu in Guangdong province who migrated to Singapore at age 13. Over time, he became highly sought after by local merchants who commissioned him to produce calligraphy for their signboards. These signboards can still be found outside Poh Seng Jewellers and Tiong Shian Coffee Shop along New Bridge Road.\nXu Yun Zhi, (1890-1960)\nXu Yun Zhi was a former teacher in his hometown in Kinmen County before coming to Singapore to work at Overseas Chinese Bank Corporation. He was one of the founders of Khoh Clan Association and served as Director of General Affairs at Kim Mui Hoey Kuan. Xu’s calligraphic works can be found on the building façades of Khoh Clan Association along Amoy Street and Chung Hwa Free Clinic at Telok Ayer Street.\nPan Shou, (1911–1999)\nPan Shou was born in Nan’an, Fujian Province, and migrated to Singapore in 1929 at the age of 19. Pan became the first calligrapher to be awarded the Cultural Medallion in 1987, and his calligraphy can be found on the façade of the Siong Leng Musical Association building along Bukit Pasoh Road. Pan wrote the five characters of the association’s name in 1992, as well as his name and the date of the inscription.\nTraditional Chinese Teahouse and Tea Appreciation\nIn the early 20th century, traditional Chinese teahouses were important social spaces for the Chinese community where patrons could meet to mingle and be entertained. The patrons of these teahouses would drink tea and chat with friends while enjoying Chinese opera or nanyin performances at the same time.\nTea Appreciation\nThe origin of Chinese tea dates back to more than 3,000 years ago when the plant was used as a medicinal remedy in China. Due to its detoxifying and reinvigorating qualities, tea is widely consumed by people from all walks of life, and has become an integral part of Chinese culture, playing important roles in religious rituals, social customs and food heritage.\nThe act of brewing and drinking tea is regarded as a cultural art form. Tea brewers will match the selected tea with the right tea wares, infuse tea leaves in freshly boiled water, and pour tea into individual serving cups. There are different methods of brewing for different types of tea. For example, green tea is best brewed using a moderately high temperature while red tea will take a longer time to brew as its leaves are thicker.\nAlthough tea has a long history, the import of tea into Singapore only started in 1819 when the British established Singapore as a trading post. During the period, local tea merchants imported tea from the Fujian province in China, and later from Taiwan from the late 1940s onwards. Due to strong local demand for tea, a number of tea firms were established in the 1920-30s, including Pek Sin Choon Tea Merchant, Guan Chong Bee Tea Merchant and the former Lim Kim Thye Tea Merchant.\nA tea appreciation workshop at Kreta Ayer Heritage Gallery, 2019\nCourtesy of National Heritage Board.\nA close-up of a traditional Chinese tea set, 2019.\nCourtesy of National Heritage Board.\nLiving Traditions\nAs Singapore transitions into the 21st century, new and alternative forms of entertainment such as digital games, movies and the internet have become popular. Consequently, cultural art forms such as Chinese opera and puppetry etc. are increasingly seen as leisure activities of the past. Nevertheless, devoted practitioners and stalwart supporters have continued to preserve and promote these cultural art forms to the younger generation.\nIn an effort to reach out to multicultural and younger audiences, some of these practitioners and performing troupes have introduced innovations into their cultural art forms by using different instruments, infusing other art forms, incorporating multi-media elements and even using English subtitles. Others have stepped up their outreach efforts to schools, community centres and museums in order to reach out to new audiences.\nChildren from Nam Hwa Opera’s Teochew opera classes, undated.\nCourtesy of Nam Hwa Opera.\nYounger members from Siong Leng Musical Association, undated.\nCourtesy of Siong Leng Musical Association.\nYong Cheong Thye and his student Malik Mazlan, 2019.\nCourtesy of National Heritage Board.\nExplore 3D Space", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/Kreta-Ayer-Heritage-Gallery", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/kreta-ayer/kreta-ayer-heritage-galleries/header_ka.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:28"},

Since Nam Hwa Opera’s earliest days as a group of amateurs brought together by a love of Teochew opera, this spirit of cultural exploration and critical inquiry has been evident. For millennia, the performing arts have been a medium for people to express, examine and redefine their culture and heritage. Since Nam Hwa Opera’s earliest days as a group of amateurs brought together by a love of Teochew opera, this spirit of cultural exploration and critical inquiry has been evident.\nWatch: Stewards of Intangible Cultural Heritage Award - Nam Hwa\n  Ahead of their debut public performance in 1963, the amateur opera enthusiasts had few resources to lean on. Inventively, the performers sought out screenings of the 1962 Teochew opera movie Chen San and Wu Niang, diligently studying the expressions and interactions of characters, including the eponymous lovelorn couple.\nToday, after decades of advancing its operatic craft and building itself as an institution, Nam Hwa has established itself as one of Singapore’s premier performing arts companies, with a prolific opera troupe, a Teochew music ensemble, a talent development programme and a cultural research centre under its umbrella.\nFrom its amateur roots to its current roles, what lay behind this consistent attention to detail, this drive to master the fundamentals of chang (singing), nian (reciting) and zuo (acting)? What motivated the performers over the years to absorb the unspoken but myriad range of emotions expressed by the movements of the shui xiu (water sleeves) and other aesthetic elements?\nThe elements of Teochew opera, from plots to characterisations and performance language, from lyrics and dialogue to set design, speak volumes of the values of generations past. These values include filial piety, loyalty, justice, and the responsibilities and bonds individuals have and maintain within society.\n“Roots are important for building up a person’s character by inculcating values, and if you want to keep these values, then the preservation of art forms is key”, says Nam Hwa’s president Toh Lim Mok.\nMastering the art of Singaporean Teochew opera\nDedication to the craft and cultural transmission of Teochew opera has been a vital strand in Nam Hwa’s DNA over the past half-century. For decades, the company moved to professionalise its craft and operations by regularly engaging with directors, performers and trainers from foreign troupes. The expertise of and exchange with foreign practitioners, as well as Nam Hwa’s travels to perform in China, South Korea and Cambodia among other countries, means that the company has absorbed and reflected a wide range of operatic styles.\nAlong with other local groups, Nam Hwa was also part of the evolution of a Singaporean style of Teochew opera, which has made it different from its Chao Shan origins. While sustaining traditional Chinese values and customs, the practice of Teochew opera here has also organically assimilated influences from the island’s multicultural society.\nDetermined to engage audiences of different generations and cultural perspectives, Nam Hwa has set traditional stories in modern environments, such as Jin Hua Sending Her Husband Off, a classic tale given a twist with contemporary outfits and familiar accessories such as passports and handbags.\nStories with local narratives, themes and settings, including Match-making at the Five-foot Way and Voyage to Nanyang, have also delighted audiences. Other innovations such as collaborations with Chinese orchestras and experiments with zhe zi xi (excerpt operas) are all closely tied to the company’s philosophy of keeping Teochew opera and culture alive by remaining connected and relevant to the community.\nFrom the opera stage to the Teochew world\nNam Hwa’s well-regarded talent development programme, helmed by opera professionals, also provides different performing pathways and platforms for student performers. Young talents are introduced to the art form through engagements with schools, nurtured through acting, singing and music classes, and given opportunities to shine on the Nam Hwa Blazes platform, a series of free public performances.\nOne such talent, 17-year-old Tan Wei Tian, says: “I love Teochew opera because it’s a very magical, and fascinating art form. There are many messages and stories to tell from the performances…and I think that our future generations should be able to get to know Teochew opera to have a deeper understanding of their roots and embrace their traditions.”\nA Nam Hwa Opera instructor guiding a young learner through fundamental movements in Teochew opera performances, 2020. Courtesy of National Heritage Board.\nTan’s passion for the art form has taken her in front of audiences in Singapore, Malaysia, Cambodia and China, including at a TEDxSingapore event, and led to her being named as an ambassador for a Singapore Tourism Board campaign.\nNam Hwa’s programmes and workshops extend to the community and amateur circles. Nam Hwa also offers introductory classes for children and adults in acting, dance and vocal fundamentals, stage makeup, the Teochew language, musical performance. To encourage intergenerational learning and exchange, drama courses designed for parents and children to participate in together are also offered.\nBeyond training performers and musicians, and giving them platforms to showcase their virtuosity, the company has also established the Yeo Khee Lim Teochew Culture Research Centre. The centre explores the manifold aspects of Teochew opera and the broader cultural heritage it draws upon through a collection of publications, Teochew opera songs digitised from vinyl records, and works produced by Teochew artists.\nEstablished to promote deeper and wider understanding of the Teochew culture among the public, the centre also collaborates with academia and supports further research and documentation through publishing, academic forums, exhibitions and research scholarships.", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/Nam-Hwa-Opera-Tradition-professionalism-and-cultural-transmission/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/Nam-Hawa-Opera-Tradition-professionalism-and-cultural-transmission/Cover-Photo-Nam-Hwa.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:28"},

The Malay word “Peranakan” commonly refers to the creolized Chinese who lived in Southeast Asia. Text by John Teo and Jackie Yoong\nMuseSG Volume 8 Issue 2 - Jul to Sep 2015\nTan Tock Seng, Goh Keng Swee and the late Lee Kuan Yew — all integral Singaporean icons, and all of them “Peranakan”. The Malay word “Peranakan” commonly refers to the creolized Chinese who lived in Southeast Asia. The community gained a reputation with its close ties to the British under colonial rule, but were also crucial players in Sun Yat Sen’s revolutionary activities and of course, our country’s rise since independence. In celebration of our country’s 50th anniversary, an exhibition showcasing the lives of 50 great Peranakans who contributed significantly to the development of our nation ran at the Peranakan Museum in 2015.\nThe featured 50 Peranakans in the exhibition\n‘Great Men’\nIn our reading of Singapore’s history, we must not forget the pivotal role Peranakans have played in shaping it — from the obscure kapitans, the baba captains of industry, to members of our first Legislative Council. We must also dispel the myths and misconceptions surrounding the community. The Peranakans were not merely rich, English-educated dilettantes who collaborated with the British and Dutch colonial masters, nor were they part of the large migration of Chinese who came to Singapore to find a better life. Women are outnumbered in the selected group for the exhibition, which to a certain extent reflects the cloistered lives of nyonyas before the twentieth century. But while the lives of Peranakan women are not as well documented, their contributions are apparent in the community’s culture, including in the aspects of dress, food, residences, and social behaviour.\nCrossing Boundaries\nThe Peranakans’ influence spread beyond the shores of Singapore. While the 50 featured in the exhibition were selected based on their contributions to Singapore, many were born and had made large impacts elsewhere. The community’s strong connections to Malacca, Penang, and Java highlight Singapore’s comparative newness as an independent entity. From 1819 to 1959, Singapore functioned as a British colony and the centrepiece of the Straits Settlements. Many of the individuals who found their way to the young nation also had connections and family networks throughout the region.\nThe Peranakans were quick to adapt to changing political circumstances. During the colonial period, they became powerful compradors and collaborators with the British and Dutch regimes. With the rise of Chinese nationalism in the late nineteenth century, some became crucial players in Sun Yat Sen’s revolutionary activities both within and outside China. Most leaders saw no contradiction in supporting both the British and the Chinese. World War II marked a turning point, after which some Peranakans began to champion for an independent Singapore and Malaya. The common caricature of Peranakans as “King’s Chinese” and their closeness to the British should not obscure their active engagement with Chinese culture and the Chinese community. Although many Peranakans lost their fluency and literacy in Chinese, they nonetheless supported Chinese or bilingual education, and founded Chinese newspapers. Some Peranakans converted to Christianity from around 1900, while others rediscovered Confucianism. Peranakans carefully balanced the two empires of British and Chinese. As they knelt loyally to receive visiting British royals, they also paid homage to Qing dignitaries. As some proudly received British decorations, they also purchased overseas Chinese honours.\nBeyond their national contributions, a study of institutional histories and memories related to the selected Peranakans has also revealed individual legacies. These are documented in temples, associations, churches, schools, hospitals, and private families, as well as in libraries, archives, and museums. Many of the objects shown in the exhibition are hybrid in form and design. The exhibition did not attempt to represent or define a Peranakan aesthetic, but, rather, celebrated the variety and inconsistencies within the community. Memoirs, interviews, and private collections paint intimate images of these exemplary figures. The objects featured in this exhibition ranged from spectacular furnishings, personal belongings, and rare portraits, to humble images, handwritten papers, and objects of everyday use.\nOne notable aspect of Peranakan families today is the extent of their knowledge of their past and their relations, whether by blood, marriage, or friendship. The Peranakan Museum is grateful for their generosity in supporting this exhibition and has been impressed by the strong sense of community and connectivity among Peranakans — ties which seem to have strengthened in recent years with the revival of interest in Peranakan culture. The Peranakans remind us that Singapore has long been closely connected with family and trade networks with the region — not only Penang and Malacca but also Jakarta and the rest of Java, and elsewhere. Taken as a whole, the biographies and objects on display in the exhibition illuminate not just the history of the Peranakans in Singapore, but that of the wider nation as well.\nTan Tock Seng\nThe First Community Leader 1798–1850\nPortrait of Tan Tock Seng, 1950s. Oil on canvas. Collection of Tan Jiew Hoe.\nBorn in Malacca, Tan Tock Seng moved to Singapore in the year it was founded by the British. He sold produce before building a fortune as a landowner in partnership with J. H. Whitehead of Shaw, Whitehead and Co. Tan was the first Asian to be appointed a Justice of the Peace in Singapore and is remembered principally for founding Singapore’s first hospital for poor Chinese.\nAt the request of the governor of Singapore, William Butterworth, Tan contributed $7,000 to start a public hospital. In 1844, the foundation was laid for the Chinese Paupers’ Hospital, which received its first patients in 1849. The hospital was named after Tan Tock Seng after his death in 1850.\nLim Nee Soon\nPineapple King And Chinese Nationalist Supporter 1879–1936\nLim Nee Soon, China Studio, early 20th century. Photograph. Collection of Ivy Kwa.\nIn 1911, Lim Nee Soon started a rubber and pineapple company. His large plantations in the booming pineapple industry soon earned him the nickname of “pineapple king”. A close friend of Sun Yat Sen, Lim became deeply involved in Chinese Nationalist politics. In 1904, together with Teo Eng Hock and Tan Chor Nam, he founded the revolutionary newspaper Thoe Lam Jit Poh (图南日报). Lim also participated in the founding of the Singapore branch of the Tong Meng Hui (同盟会), the Nationalist underground organisation. The organizers met at Teo Eng Hock’s house, Wan Qing Yuan (晚晴园), which is today the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall. In 1925, Lim became an honorary advisor to the president of China. He was given a state funeral in Nanjing and buried near Sun Yat Sen’s mausoleum.\nGoh Soon Tioe\nMaestro and Impresario 1911–1982\nGoh Soon Tioe, 1940s. Photograph. Collection of Vivien Goh.\nGoh Soon Tioe was a pioneer in the development of classical music in Singapore. Born in Padang, Sumatra, he came to Singapore at the age of 13 to study at the Anglo-Chinese School. Goh only started violin lessons at the age of 15 but showed great promise, and in 1932 he left for Switzerland to join the Conservatoire de Musique de Genève, where he studied for three years. During his time there, he was awarded the “Premier Prix” — first prize — in each annual exam.\nIn 1954, Goh founded the Goh Soon Tioe String Orchestra. In the 1950s and 1960s, he ventured into concert promotion by bringing internationally renowned musicians to perform in Singapore. However, he was not able to continue organising these concerts because, as he observed, “costs are heavy and work is hard”. In his studio above a garage in Oldham Lane and later in his home in Balmoral Crescent, he taught many of Singapore’s musical prodigies, including violinists Lynnette Seah and Lee Pan Hon, pianists Seow Yit Kin and Melvyn Tan, and conductor Choo Hoey. Goh was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal in 1963 in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the music scene in Singapore.\nLee Choo Neo\nSingapore’s First Female Doctor 1895–1947\nWedding photograph of Teo Koon Lim and Lee Choo Neo, 1922. Photograph. Collection of Vera Teo.\nLee Choo Neo was Singapore’s first female physician. Breaking away from the tradition of the cloistered nyonya, she used her privileged position to help enact social reforms. Lee was the daughter of Lee Hoon Leong, a Peranakan from Semarang who was manager of Oei Tiong Ham’s shipping business in Singapore. Educated at the Singapore Chinese Girls’ School, she was the first Straits Chinese woman to obtain a Senior Cambridge certificate in 1911. She studied at the King Edward VII School of Medicine in Singapore, and became the city’s first Chinese female doctor in 1920.

They arrived in Singapore, where they were cared for by Father (Fr) Stephen Lee, parish priest of the Church of Saints Peter and Paul, as well as other prominent Catholic Teochews. In 1933, the government granted land in Mandai to these refugees, where they established Mandai Catholic Village and built a chapel dedicated to Anthony of Padua, a Portuguese-Franciscan saint devoted to the poor and lost. \n\nTo cater to Mandai’s growing Catholic community, a larger church was built in 1960 with the help of parish priest Fr Joachim Teng. The church’s congregation expanded over the years and by the late 1970s, it also served residents of the new Woodlands satellite town nearby. After the Mandai villagers were resettled in the late 1980s, parish priest Fr John Khoo helped to build the present Church of St Anthony of Padua in Woodlands.\n\nThe Church of St Anthony of Padua continues to serve Woodlands’ Catholic community today. It underwent renovation in 2019-2020, which saw the building of 12 lanced arches on its façade, symbolising the 12 apostles in the Bible.

Join NAFA Arts Management students on a walkthrough as they document their observations and research of the many natural elements waiting to be discovered at Fort Canning, Raffles’ Garden, and Artisan’s Garden. Focusing on the topics of plants and archaeology in Natural Heritage, this essay will present a holistic overview of the prominent presence of natural heritage in the precinct’s history.\nText by Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts\n\nThe Bras Basah.Bugis precinct is undeniably one of the oldest districts in Singapore. Since the 19th century, it has been home to many diverse communities, arts groups, and national monuments, but also to some of our commonly seen flora and fauna in Singapore. Often associated with historical landmarks such as the former St. Joseph's institution and Maghain Aboth, the precinct brings together some of the most tangible symbols of Singapore’s history. A gem carefully tucked away behind the National Museum of Singapore, Fort Canning is home to Singapore’s first botanical gardens, where many hidden elements of natural heritage can be discovered. This photo essay will unravel the natural heritage of Fort Canning and the many treasures that it holds. From the magnificent Tree Tunnel with a towering Samanea Saman tree hanging over it, to the Raffles and Artisan’s Gardens, this photo essay will detail the natural heritage and archaeological history that BBB has to offer.\nSamanea Saman, 2022 (Source: Aleesha Rane)\nThe first location of our walk takes us through the Fort Canning Tree Tunnel and up the iconic spiral staircase which leads explorers to a distinctive Samanea Saman tree that towers high above the tunnel. The Samanea Saman tree is easily recognisable by its umbrella-shaped crown that can reach 20m to 30m across! It is also known as Pukul Lima in Malay, which means “5 o’clock”. This is a reference to how the tree’s leaves fold at sunset, which used to be at 5P.M, before the Singapore Standard Time was changed.\nOpened in 2007, the tree tunnel has become one of Singapore’s most iconic photography spots. With the beautiful crown of the Samanea Saman reaching over the tree tunnel, sunlight filters through the leaves to illuminate the spiral staircase below. This spot reflects Singapore’s relationship between man-made architecture and how our existing natural heritage adapts and complements the changes around it. The Samanea Saman tree has made this location its home before the existence of the tunnel, its strong foothold on Fort Canning being attributed to its tolerance for infertile and waterlogged soils. Despite Singapore's monsoon seasons, this tenacious tree stands tall till today, enhancing Fort Canning landscape as a symbol of Singapore’s natural heritage.\nAlpinia Purpurata (Red Ginger), 2022 (Source: Aleesha Rane)\nFort Canning is home to several historical gardens, some of which are named after symbolic figures in Singapore’s history. A few minutes of walking from the Tree Tunnel will take you to spots like the Raffles Garden and the Sang Nila Utama Garden which is a hidden treasure trove of flora and fauna. Countless species of ginger, like the Red Ginger pictured above, can be found planted alongside the brick paths, accompanied with iconic flowering plants like the periwinkle.\nThe Red Ginger in particular, can be found planted alongside Singapore’s roadsides and in other tropical areas outside of Asia such as Hawaii. Since its introduction into the Singaporean landscape, the plant has been thought to hold medicinal properties in its stem. Easily identified by its use in traditional medicine, the Alpinia Purpurata is used to treat a wide range of health conditions, including morning sickness, nausea, and cardiovascular disease.\nCatharanthus Roseus (Periwinkle), 2022 (Source: Aleesha Rane)\nIn the gardens, you will find an abundance of vibrant, flowering plants. One such example is the periwinkle, a perennial plant native to Madagascar. Having been introduced into Singapore's natural landscape, the shrub shares many medicinal traits with the Red Ginger. The Red Ginger is also recognised for its many traditional medicinal properties, even outside of the continent of Asia - its leaves and flower petals are boiled to create teas referred to as “solar tea”. It is often sipped throughout the day to help with conditions like toothaches and chest pain. Even modern medical research has shown that certain extracts from the plant can be used in anti-cancer drugs, to treat diseases such as leukaemia and Hogkins’ Disease.\nHowever, the Catharanthus Roseus, also known as the Pink Periwinkle, was initially grown as a ground cover, no doubt due to its vibrant, eye-catching pink flowers. Holding the “Exotic” status under Singapore’s National Parks database, the relatively drought-tolerant plant can easily be spotted in shrubs, planted alongside neighbourhood streets and on roadsides.\n“Wildness reminds us what it means to be human“\n- Terry Tempest Williams\nPandanus Amaryllifolius (Pandan), 2022 (Source: Aleesha Rane)\nFound amongst the leafy and forested landscape of Fort Canning are some easily recognisable plants that contribute to other facets of heritage, such as food. One favourite of Singaporeans and commonly found in most households is pandan. Often used in cooking and baking desserts and local dishes it is also most famously known for making up the bulk of kaya, a traditional spread eaten with bread.\nPandan has been found to host medicinal properties as well. Used in traditional medicine to alleviate pain symptoms, specifically that of arthritis and joint pain, it is a plant that has cemented its place in Singapore’s natural heritage landscape. Like many other mainstay ingredients in Singaporean kitchens, the pandan is a plant whose nativity we share with the wider Southeast Asian region. This is not a bad thing though, because iconic heritage elements, such as the pandan, help the region foster a unified tale of history and heritage.\nArtisan’s Garden, 2022 (Source: Aleesha Rane)\nYet another treasure trove of Fort Canning is the Artisan's Garden that was said to be built around the 14th century amidst the hill’s flora and fauna. Left with only its remains today, it is currently an excavation site and was formerly a craftsman’s workshop and living quarters. While the garden no longer withholds as much flora and fauna as it once did, it still showcases the many natural elements that lie below the grounds of Fort Canning. With extensive research detailing the specific soil layers and brickwork found in the garden’s foundations, educational panels are placed around the Artisan’s Garden to help visitors uncover the rich history of this location. The Artisan’s Garden has now become an integral part of the natural heritage found in Fort Canning.\nDid you know that Fort Canning holds a shrine dedicated to Sultan Keramat Iskandar Shah, the last king of Singapura and the first Sultan of the Malacca Sultanate? In 1985 and 1988, excavation works near the keramat (shrine) revealed 3 soil types below the top layer. These included red laterite (which was not native to Fort Canning at the time), a dark brown soil that dated back to the 14th century, and a natural yellow soil that had formed due to the weathering of the sandstone bedrock over time. The garden even has exhibits fitted with magnifying lenses for visitors to look at the soil types in detail!\nArtisan’s Garden, 2022 (Source: Aleesha Rane)\nThe image above is one example of the type of exhibits found at the Artisan’s Garden. A glass showcase holding fragments of traditional porcelain china can be seen, with the fragments laid out on the dirt. Many of the garden’s exhibits feature detailed geographical samples, including preserved fragments of china, limestone collections, and sediment types from the ground beneath the garden. Despite the site having been abandoned before discovery, the presence of early 20th century artefacts reaffirmed beliefs that the area had previously been occupied. It also showed how prevalent and extensive trade was at the time, that goods from China and around the region had been found in Singaporean lives.\nWith your newfound knowledge of natural heritage found integrated with the rich histories of Fort Canning, can you identify other elements of Natural Heritage found around you? We encourage you to explore the natural heritage that is still present in Singapore’s landscape today.\nSome of the research done in this essay takes reference from traditional medicinal uses that may remain unproven by modern medicine.

They arrived in Singapore, where they were cared for by Father (Fr) Stephen Lee, parish priest of the Church of Saints Peter and Paul, as well as other prominent Catholic Teochews. In 1933, the government granted land in Mandai to these refugees, where they established Mandai Catholic Village and built a chapel dedicated to Anthony of Padua, a Portuguese-Franciscan saint devoted to the poor and lost. \n\nTo cater to Mandai’s growing Catholic community, a larger church was built in 1960 with the help of parish priest Fr Joachim Teng. The church’s congregation expanded over the years and by the late 1970s, it also served residents of the new Woodlands satellite town nearby. After the Mandai villagers were resettled in the late 1980s, parish priest Fr John Khoo helped to build the present Church of St Anthony of Padua in Woodlands.\n\nThe Church of St Anthony of Padua continues to serve Woodlands’ Catholic community today. It underwent renovation in 2019-2020, which saw the building of 12 lanced arches on its façade, symbolising the 12 apostles in the Bible. A bronze statue of St Anthony stands at the entrance, and the worship hall has an altar table that was used by Pope John Paul II to celebrate Mass when he visited Singapore in 1986.\nOther Suggested Short Trail Routes\nExplore the Suggested Short Trail Routes:\n- Communities of Woodlands, 1.5 hours with public transport (4km)\n- Woodlands at War, 2 hours with public transport (9km)\n- A Journey through the Woods, 1.5 hours on bike; 2.5 hours on foot with public transport (15km)\nDownloads\nWoodlands Heritage Trail Booklet\nWoodlands Heritage Trail Map - English\nWoodlands Heritage Trail Map - Chinese\nWoodlands Heritage Trail Map - Malay\nWoodlands Heritage Trail Map - Tamil\nWoodlands Heritage Trail Markers - Chinese\nWoodlands Heritage Trail Markers - Malay\nWoodlands Heritage Trail Markers - Tamil\nOpened on 23 April 1994 by Archbishop Gregory Yong, the Church of St Anthony of Padua has a unique history as a parish that was established as a rural settlement for refugees from China.", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/places/places-landing/Places/landmarks/Communities-of-Woodlands/Church-of-St-Anthony-of-Padua", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/landmarks/woodlands-heritage-trail/Church-of-St-Anthony-of-Padua/The-Church-of-St-Anthony-of-Padua.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:29"},

Mr Ho is an industry pioneer and an industry leader. Through his long career as a farmer, he has championed the cause of farmers and worked to share his knowledge and experience with the farming community.\nThe modernity of Singapore today may have led us to forget that farming was once a major economic activity in rural areas such as Choa Chu Kang, Seletar, Jurong and Punggol. In the late 1950s, local farms were able to meet the needs of the island’s population of 1.6 million people, despite poor soil conditions and traditional farming methods. By the late 1960s, Singapore had 20,000 farms occupying 14,000 hectares.\n89-year-old Mr. Ho Seng Choon is a pioneer in Singapore’s poultry sector. Born in Fujian Province in China, Ho moved to Singapore in 1929 where his father ran a provision shop in Chinatown. After World War 2, Ho saw potential in poultry farming and travelled abroad to learn the latest methods in livestock breeding and production.\nThrough continuous innovation, Seng Choon overcame constraints in land, and raised productivity in poultry farming. Today, the sole proprietorship has grown into a conglomerate with farms in Singapore and Johor and retail lines for battery systems and feed mills, husbandry consultancy and education.

A set of jewellery, Philippines, c. 19th-20th Century, Collection of Asian Civilisations Museum\nMUSESG Volume 15 Issue 1 – January 2022\nText by Naomi Wang\nRead the full MUSE SG Vol 15 Issue 1\n  In 2020, the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) received a gift of Philippine jewellery from the Montilla clan, one of the earliest settler families in Negros Occidental, Philippines. Handed down four generations, this is a significant donation as it furthers ACM’s mission in promoting cross-cultural art and sheds light on centuries of goldsmithing and trade in the Philippines.\nThe Montilla Clan\n  Josefa Jordan Ortaliz (birth and death unknown) was the daughter-in-law of the family’s patriarch, Agustin Orendain Montilla (1802–?), a Philippine-born Spaniard who married Vicenta Locsin-Zarandin Yanson (1807–?), a mestiza from Iloilo.1 Ortaliz bequeathed her jewels to her eldest daughter, Lina Ortaliz Montilla (1868–1939), and she thence to her daughters, Lilia Montilla y Montilla (1901–83) and Lina Juana Montilla y Montilla (1906–85).\n  (Fig. 2) Lina Ortaliz Montilla (1868–1939) and her first cousin and husband Candido Montilla (1871–1943). Philippines, circa 1931. Photograph. Private collection.\nFrom the Montilla sisters, the jewels were passed down to their niece, Corazon Arroyo Montilla (1933–2021). Separately, a pair of diamond earrings were gifted to Corazon for her high school graduation from her grandaunt Doña Leoncia Lacson y Torres (1903–81). The latter had received the earrings from her father, General Aniceto Lacson y Ledesma (1857–1931), who served as president of the shortlived Republic of Negros in 1899.\n  Agustin Orendain Montilla relocated to Negros Island from Manila to set up an agricultural settlement in Pulupandan. He grew a variety of crops, including rice, abaca and maize, and later became one of the first to produce sugar on a commercial scale in the Philippines.2 Negros Island became a dominant player in the world’s sugar economy in the 19th century.\n  (Fig. 3) The Montilla family crest with lineage from Córdoba, Spain (reproduction). Philippines, 1950s. Paper, ink. Private collection.\nComposed of thousands of islands, the cultural fabric of the Philippines is diverse. The Negrenses from Negros Island are proud of their distinct culture and language. On the island, two main languages (different from Tagalog) are spoken: Hiligaynon in the province of Negros Occidental (northwestern Negros Island), where the Montilla family settled; and Cebuano in Negros Oriental (southeastern Negros Island).\n  Beyond Manila: Multiple Centres of Commerce\n  “From China come many persons able and willing to engage in all sorts of trades and they are skilful, quick and economical. They are… tailors, the shoemakers, and the silversmiths, the sculptors… and they take over all classes of work in the city.”\n—Fr. Pedro Chirino3\n  Historically, the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean served as natural conduits for cross-cultural interaction between individuals of various faiths, cultures and occupations.4 Even before the 1521 arrival of Spanish conquistadors in the Philippines, multiple centres, such as Cebu and Iloilo (on either side of Negros Island), had been flourishing ports with developed settlements. Under Spanish rule, these centres continued to evolve due to intensified global interaction.\n  From 1571 to 1815, the galleon trade made Manila’s walled city, Intramuros, one of the main entrepots of the world.5 From nutmeg from the Moluccas to coral from the Mediterranean Sea, the world’s luxury goods converged in Manila’s multicultural trading hub, where pidgin Hokkien or pidgin Spanish with Tagalog elements developed in the course of daily encounters.6\n  (Fig. 4) The Montilla ancestral home known as Balay Daku (‘big house’ in Hiligaynon), built in 1853. Negros Island, Philippines. Photograph. Private collection.\nIt was against this backdrop of mercantile activity that the exchange of goods and ideas occurred. The racial hierarchy imposed under Spain’s colonial rule placed Peninsulares (Spaniards born in Spain) on top and Indios (indigenous inhabitants of the Philippines) at the bottom.\n  However, this did not impede interactions between people of different classes and ethnic backgrounds. It was in the Parian, a Chinese-designated area outside the walled city of Manila, where the Spanish made their orders, and where itinerant artisans produced objects according to the varied tastes of customers, further fuelling artistic exchange and creativity.7\n  From the 16th century, Spanish accounts have noted the impressive command of techniques by local goldsmiths. Multiple centres for jewellery production soon developed, drawing large numbers of local and foreign goldsmiths to areas beyond Manila, including Luzon Island, Damortis in the province of La Union, and Vigan and Bantay in the Ilocos Region.8\n  The influx of local and itinerant smiths contributed to the hybrid nature of Philippine jewellery. The abundance of silver due to the galleon trade attracted Chinese silver artisans from Guangzhou and Fujian, where the famed Chinese silver export market had been established in the latter half of the 17th century.9\n  By the 19th century, descendants of these immigrant artisans had assimilated into Philippine society, and were working in a style heavily influenced by European demand and the varying tastes of local communities.10\n  Practical Liaisons: Mixed-race Marriages and Hybrid Tastes\n  In the 17th to 19th centuries, travellers to Asia often recorded observations of racially hybrid communities in port cities.11 Mixed marriages such as that between Montilla and Yanson, were practical: they allowed foreign businessmen to access Asian networks and grow commercial opportunities, as the local wives could speak several languages and understand two or more cultures.12\n  As ‘cross-cultural brokers’, mixed communities became indispensable in trade and politics.13 It was against this backdrop of cultural and religious mixing that indigenous communities, Christian Chinese, and mestizos of mixed Spanish, Chinese and Indios origin, developed hybrid forms of art and manners of dress.14\n  (Fig. 5) Portrait of Josefa Jordan Ortaliz Montilla based on a photograph from the 1890s. Fernando Amorsolo (1892–1972). Philippines, 1950s. Oil on canvas. Private collection.\nJosefa Jordan Ortaliz married Montilla and Yanson’s oldest son, Bonifacio Yanson Montilla (birth and death unknown), in 1867.15 A portrait of Josefa based on a photograph from the 1890s shows the hybrid dress of a wealthy mestiza (Fig. 5). Notably, a large gold peineta (comb) holds her chignon in place.\n  Peinetas were used until the mid-20th century, and were eventually made obsolete as shorter hairstyles became de rigueur. While tortoiseshell combs were popular in Spain by the 19th century, crescent-shaped combs are Chinese in origin, and the Spanish vogue for tortoiseshell combs was likely due to the Manila galleon trade through Spain’s colonies.16 Two peinetas (see Figs. 1 and 6) worn by Ortaliz are made of gold, silver, tortoiseshell and seed pearls from the Sulu archipelago. These lavish materials reflect the resource-rich bounty of the Philippines.\n  (Fig. 6) These peineta and veil hairpins illustrate the accomplished work of local goldsmiths. Peineta, Manila, Philippines, c. 1870s, Collection of Asian Civilisations Museum.\nHistorically, the Philippines was rich in natural resources beyond gold. Valuable sea products like tortoiseshell and pearls are indigenous to the Philippines. The hawksbill tortoise, now sadly endangered, enabled workshops in Manila to become major producers of luxury products made from tortoiseshell. The trade of pearls is likewise centuries old. As early as 1349, the Chinese traveller Wang Dayuan had observed that “pearls from the Sulu archipelago were prized for their lasting blue-ish white colour, and traded for gold, silver and iron bars”.17\n  The gold and silver peineta and veil hairpins (Fig. 6) illustrate the accomplished work of local goldsmiths. The undulating outlines of golden flowers and leaves reveal the remarkable ability of local craftsmen to go beyond imitating European jewellery styles, to create objects of great naturalism. During this time, botanical drawings inspired a Victorian fondness for floral and vegetal motifs. In these ornaments, the flowers and leaves capture the essence of life and movement in nature.\n  (Fig. 6) These peineta and veil hairpins illustrate the accomplished work of local goldsmiths. Veil Hairpins, Manila, Philippines, c. 1870s, Collection of Asian Civilisations Museum.\nCenturies of goldsmithing knowledge enabled local smiths to work in a wide range of techniques and forms, their skills and inspiration garnered from a myriad of cultures. Oblong criollas (earrings) derived their name from hoop earrings worn by Mexicans of mixed race.18\n  The form of these earrings has an equally hybrid origin as they take after Spanish ear ornaments, though they originate from styles introduced to Spain by Muslim rulers (the Umayyad Caliphate was in Spain by the 10th century)—hoop earrings appear frequently in medieval Islamic jewellery.19 In Figure 7, we see the rare example of criollas that are each decorated with a bird holding a rice stalk in its beak (criollas embellished with floral and vegetal motifs are more common).\n  (Fig. 7) A pair of criollas (earrings) with birds. Criollas, Northern Luzon, Ilocos region, c. mid-19th century, Collection of Asian Civilisations Museum Gift of the Montilla Family of Pulupandan, Negros Occidental\n(Fig. 7) A pair of criollas (earrings) with birds. Criollas, Northern Luzon, Ilocos region, c. mid-19th century, Collection of Asian Civilisations Museum Gift of the Montilla Family of Pulupandan, Negros Occidental\nEuropean Religion and Superstition in Philippine Jewellery\n  In accordance with the Montilla family tradition, Ortaliz passed down her jewellery to her eldest daughter, Lina Ortaliz Montilla. The popularity of veil hairpins in the Philippines is in large part credited to the adoption of Spanish dress. They were used to secure prestige accessories like the lace pañuelo (veil), which wealthy native and mestiza women wore to church as an indication of modesty, religious devotion and upper-class status.20\n  Devotional jewellery played a central role in Philippine dress. Beyond religious piety, Christian ornaments indicated an allegiance to Spanish rule and luxurious ones conveyed social status. Religious jewellery from the Philippines, though taking after Spanish examples, have their own distinctive character and gradually evolved to adopt a native style.\n \n(Fig. 8) Lithograph of a mestiza wearing a veil with hairpins. Una India de Manila, Philippines, c. mid-19th century, Collection of National Gallery Singapore\nUndoubtedly, other influences—from the Chinese, for instance—also played a key role in trade and goldsmithing in Manila.21 The centuries-long Chinese–Philippine interactions are evident in how natives in the Philippines used Chinese terms for gold weight, tools and techniques long before Spanish arrival.22\n  In Figure 9, we see a gold bead on the coral rosary which is decorated with stylised Chinese character 寿 (shou), which refers to ‘longevity’. Jewellery with highly prized coral beads (see criollas with coral beads in Fig. 1) were a marker of luxury, and they reflect the trading port status of the Philippines. Because Manila was a doorway to the global trading world, luxury commodities like coral were made available to its wealthy residents.23\n  (Fig. 9) A gold bead with the stylised Chinese character 寿(shou), meaning ‘longevity’, on a rosary. Gold bead, Philippines, late 19th or early 20th century, Collection of Asian Civilisations Museum Gift of the Montilla Family of Pulupandan, Negros Occidental\nThe use of llaveros (keychains) was also common throughout the Philippines, Java and the Straits Settlements. In the later decades of the 19th century, ringed key hooks modelled after European examples became fashionable.\n  A popular form involves a key ring suspended from a clenched fist, referred to as figa (derived from the Latin ficum facere). It is symbolically linked with the fig and signifies life. The figa is known in various cultures throughout antiquity, among them the Egyptians, Phoenicians and Etruscans, who used this symbol as an amulet. In Spain, the figa functioned as an amulet against the evil eye and was worn by children. For grown women, the phallic shape of the figa alludes to ideas of fertility.24\n  (Fig. 10) Key ring with figa (clenched fists). Such ringed key hooks became fashionable in the later decades of the 19th century. Key Ring, Philippines, late 19th or 20th century, Collection of Asian Civilisations Museum Gift of the Montilla Family of Pulupandan, Negros Occidental\nA large quantity of Chinese jewellery found in the 1638 wreck of the Nuestra Señora de la Concepción (a Manila galleon bound for Acapulco) includes several jewels with this clenched-fist motif. This attests to the widespread circulation of the figa motif and its global use spanning centuries. In the same way that the crescent-shaped peinetas were likely brought to Spain from China through its colonies, it is possible that the Portuguese and Spaniards introduced the figa symbol to their colonies in Southeast Asia.25\n  From China to the Philippines and from Mexico to the Iberian Peninsula, networks of conquest, trade and migration impacted the cross-cultural and hybrid characteristics of Philippine jewellery—and this set of jewellery from the Montilla clan is a gleaming example of that. Unearthing the provenance of these historical gems allows us to understand the culturally fluid reality of the Philippines during the 19th and mid-20th centuries, and, no doubt, their donation to ACM will contribute greatly to the study of Philippine history and material culture.\n  This article is dedicated to the memory of Corazon Arroyo Montilla who passed away on 11 June 2021.\n  Notes", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/A-Familys-Gift/Story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/A-Familys-Gift/Jewellery-set-20200065220200065320200065420200065520200065620200065720200065820200065920200066020200.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:30"},

Introduction\nA National Treasure Trove\nOpened in 2000, the Heritage Conservation Centre (HCC) is a purpose-built facility located on Jurong Port Road that serves as the repository of the National Collection (NC). It houses more than 250,000 artefacts and artworks in climate-controlled stores and conservation laboratories. Here, a dedicated team of cataloguers, collections managers, conservators, estates and support staff, photographers and scientists strive to manage and care for them to the highest professional standards.\nAs a part of wider efforts to make the NC accessible to the public, HCC plays a crucial role in supporting museum exhibitions such as An Old New World which was at National Museum Singapore (NMS) in 2019. Here at the HCC, we document and capture important information about the artefacts and artworks and prepare them for both physical and online display. We see to it that they are inventoried, and safely packed and transported to the museums. We work with our colleagues at the museums to ensure that the artefacts are displayed using methods and materials that are as safe as possible for the artefacts. For online display, besides including well taken photographs, we ensure that the artefact records are tagged with suitable metadata to enhance their searchability.\nThese essential processes are often unseen, unnoticed and unknown to the public. Check out this mini-series for information on the HCC and its different departments. Learn about the work done behind the scenes by the team in caring for the NC, whether on a regular basis or in preparation for museum exhibitions.\nManagement and Operations Group\nConservation Services\nCollections Management\nArchitecture and Unique Features of the Building\nHCC in 2000 (left); 20 years later, HCC in 2020 (right)\nThe original building opened in 2000 was a four-storey building. Due to the growing number of artefacts and artworks, the building was renovated into a six-storey building in 2008 – 2010 to create more space.\nAs HCC houses Singapore’s NC of artefacts and artworks, the building is purpose-built to preserve and conserve the collection of artefacts and artworks. The design of the building is shaped by physical site constraints and functionality.  The Loading Bay, Security Control Room and Building Automation Control Room are all located at the front of the building on the ground floor to minimise circulation requirements. It also offers the benefit of immediate building control and the optimum efficient arrangement for artefacts delivery, loading and control. The five storeys above consist of repository rooms, a viewing room, conservation laboratories and administrative offices. The floors are sealed with epoxy coating to minimise dust pollution. The custom-built steel doors, measuring 3.5m by 2.3m, are among the largest steel doors in Singapore. The walls are concrete–reinforced and aluminium–clad, for security reasons and to insulate all artefacts in the building. The building is designed with minimal windows. This also prevents sunlight from entering the building, which can harm the artefacts. The design also takes into account separate access to the artefact collections areas and building amenities; allowing access to areas with collections to be limited to authorised personnel only.\nThe images below depict the interior of the building when it was completed in 2000, before all the stores were filled. These spaces and structures remain the same till today.\nThe long corridor with the 3.5m by 2.3m steel door (one of the largest steel doors in Singapore) at the entrance on Level 1.\nManagement and Operations Group\nby Chun Boon Beng\nThe Management & Operations Group (MOG) is the corporate services arm of HCC and the key functions that it oversees include estates management, outreach, capability development, finance and office administration. HCC is continuously improving its infrastructure to ensure a conducive and safe working environment as well as to enhance the security and efficiency of the building.  HCC also organises tours to our facility and workshops to share about how we conduct collections management and our conservation efforts. Read on to find out more about two tasks carried out by MOG colleagues.\nOutreach\nHCC conducts outreach programmes to promote understanding, appreciation and awareness of preservation and conservation of heritage materials amongst the wider heritage community. Our key outreach programmes include organised tours at HCC and workshops to share knowledge about collections management and conservation. We also conduct heritage awareness tours for schools. Find out more about the HCC Tour here.\nOur tours allow visitors to peek into how our cultural heritage materials are preserved for posterity. During tours, visitors learn how historical artefacts, works of art and fine antiquities are preserved by proper environmental control, good physical storage and storage methods, and other preventive conservation measures to avert deterioration. They would also get a glimpse of artefacts undergoing conservation treatment in the laboratories. Visitors are introduced to the collection management and conservation professions, careers that are crucial in heritage preservation but relatively unheard of in Singapore.\nHCC Tour welcome and introduction briefing by Kathleen.\nEstates Management\nThe Estates Management team manages building maintenance works in supporting HCC’s operations. The team ensures the building meets statutory requirements by carrying out testing and inspection works. Security is of the utmost importance as Singapore’s heritage assets are stored in this building. There is a strict security system for access, which includes card access, closed-circuit TV, intrusion detection system. Temperature and relative humidity (RH) are monitored and controlled to ensure the environment where the different artefacts are stored is stable and suitable. As there are artefacts which are sensitive to water such as the archival collection, the Estates Management team also oversees the Inergen gas system which can put out fires without using water. The other tasks that the Estates Management team include managing contract workers for cleaning, building maintenance, landscape, and pest control.\nConducting routine inspection and maintenance of electrical and Air Conditioning and Mechanical Ventilation System (ACMV) in HCC with the help of a contract worker on the Mobile Elevating Work Platform (MEWP).\nPrevention is Better Than Cure\nby Ang Boon Kok\nBesides the MOG overseeing the building maintenance aspect, the Prevention Conservation Work Group at HCC also looks at prolonging the life span of an artefact through the practice of preventive conservation. As the name suggests, this function of conservation aims to prevent or slow down the rate of deterioration of artefacts by managing various factors like the environment in which artefacts are stored, pests, mould growth and even how artefacts are handled and transported.\nWhile conservation treatment procedures such as surface cleaning and crease relaxation help to improve the condition and appearance of artefacts, there is another important aspect to prolonging their life span – preventive conservation. As its name suggests, this function of conservation aims to prevent or slow down the rate of deterioration of artefacts, and is done through managing various factors like the environment in which artefacts are stored, pests, mould growth, and even how artefacts are handled and transported. In an exhibition, one of the ways in which appropriate environmental conditions can be provided for different types of artefacts is through the use of a well-designed showcase.\nHow do we minimise the deterioration of an artefact?\nSketch of the Fortified Cratten (Palace) of the Sultan of Djoejo Carta and Voyage aux Indes orientales by Charles-François Tombe)\nTo delay or prevent the deterioration of an artefact, we practise preventive conservation through controlling its immediate environment. Artefacts may deteriorate due to the following factors:\nEffects of Temperature and RH fluctuations\nConstant rapid fluctuations of temperature and relative humidity can result in warping, splitting, and delamination of certain sensitive material types.\nGraphs of temperature (yellow) and RH (blue) over time. (Left) Readings stay within acceptable range.

Namun, kedai mercu tanda ini, yang dikatakan sebagai kopitiam (kedai kopi) tradisional tertua yang masih bertakat di Balestier Road, telah bermula sebagai kedai roti ala Barat pada tahun 1948.\nPengasas Loong Fatt, Lee Wang Long (1922-2018), tiba di Singapura dari Hainan, China, dan mulanya bekerja sebagai pembantu rumah, di mana beliau belajar membakar paf krim ala Inggeris dan manisan yang lain. Pada tahun 1948, beliau membuka kedai roti dan kopitiam di kedai satu tingkat ini yang berkembang pada tahun 1950-an dan 1960-an. Apabila perniagaan merosot pada tahun 1970-an, Loong Fatt beralih kepada pembuatan tau sar piah.\nHari ini, keluarga Lee terus mengendalikan Loong Fatt, di mana sepasukan tukang roti menyediakan 3,000-4,000 tau sar piah setiap hari. Resipi yang tepat adalah rahsia, tetapi menurut Cik Loo Suan Mui, yang telah bekerja di Loong Fatt sejak tahun 1970-an, mentega bermutu tinggi ditambahkan untuk menghasilkan kerak yang lebih rangup. Ini berbeza daripada kerak lebih lembut pada tau sar piah yang dibuat menurut gaya Teochew tradisional.\nKedai ini telah diubah elok beberapa kali sepanjang bertahun-tahun, tetapi jubin dinding hijau dan putih asalnya serta beberapa bangku dan meja kayu telah dikekalkan. Nampaknya, tradisi tidak pernah ketinggalan zaman di Loong Fatt. Ia masih menarik perhatian orang ramai yang datang untuk menikmati makanan yang lazat dan sering beredar dengan sebuah kotak atau lebih mengandungi tau sar piah segar dari ketuharnya.\nCawan logam ini dulu digunakan untuk membuat kek mentega.\n  Pencanai kayu ini digunakan untuk menguli adunan tepung dan selepas itu, inti manis atau berempah ditambahkan. Campuran ini dimasukkan ke dalam ketuhar untuk dibakar.\nDaripada gerai di pasar kepada restoran: Nasi Ayam Terbaik Loy Kee\nSelama lebih daripada 25 tahun, ramai orang datang berduyun-duyun ke kedai sudut ini untuk menikmati ayam lazat dan nasi harum, dibumbui dengan halia giling tangan serta cecahan cili dan bawang putih buatan sendiri. Namun, mungkin tidak ramai yang menyedari bahawa Loy Kee telah menjual nasi ayam tradisional Hainan di daerah Balestier sejak tahun 1953.\nPengasas Loy Kee, Loy Nie In (1920-2007), datang ke Singapura dari Hainan pada tahun 1940-an dan isterinya, Qua Tee, menyertainya di Singapura kemudian. Pada tahun 1953, pasangan Loy itu membuka gerai kecil yang menjual nasi ayam Hainan serta bubur ayam dan daging babi di Pasar Rayman (kini Tempat Makan Whampoa), berhampiran Estet Rayman, sebuah kawasan perumahan Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) yang baru dibina.\nPerniagaan begitu baik tetapi kerjanya menjerihkan bagi pasangan Loy. James Loy, anak bongsu Loy, teringat bahawa ibu bapanya sering tidur di gerai pasar kerana mereka perlu memasak bubur dan menyediakan ayam untuk penduduk yang inginkan sarapan pagi yang enak. Pasangan Loy terus berniaga dengan baik pada tahun 1970-an apabila Estet Rayman dibangunkan semula menjadi estet Lembaga Perumahan & Pembangunan.\nPada tahun 1980-an, pasangan Loy bersara dan menyerahkan perniagaan mereka kepada anak-anak mereka. Hari ini, Loy Sai Hong, anak sulung mereka, terus mengusahakan warung nasi ayam keluarga itu di Tempat Makan Whampoa. Sementara itu, James, anak lelaki yang lebih muda, mengambil alih bekas kopitiam (kedai kopi) ini dan mengubahnya menjadi Nasi Ayam Terbaik Loy Kee pada tahun 1994.\nLoy Nie In dan Qua Tee menggunakan pisau pemotong daging ini untuk membahagi ayam untuk pelanggan mereka. Pisau yang lebih besar (di bawah) digunakan oleh Loy, sementara pisau yang lebih kecil digunakan oleh isterinya.\nRasa “Laut Selatan”: Kilang Serbuk Kopi Lam Yeo\nSejak tahun 1960, ketika Tan Thian Kang (1912-2008) membuka kedai ini, penggemar kopi tempatan yang baik telah terus sahaja memilih biji kopi Lam Yeo. \"Lam Yeo\" ialah istilah dialek Hokkien untuk \"Nanyang\" atau \"Laut Selatan\", yang merujuk kepada Asia Tenggara. Tan menamakan kedainya dengan istilah yang menggugah ini kerana beliau pernah bekerja sebagai penolong editor di Nanyang Siang Pau, sebuah akhbar berbahasa Cina yang terkenal pada tahun 1950-an.\nPeralihan Tan daripada kertas akhbar kepada serbuk kopi bermula pada tahun 1959, selepas bertugas seketika sebagai jurujual bagi sebuah kilang kopi. Beliau mula menjaja biji kopi yang dipilih sendiri dari pintu ke pintu dari belakang sebuah van. Sedang perniagaannya berkembang, Tan dan isterinya Lim Chok Tee menubuhkan kedai pada tahun 1960 sebagai Kilang Serbuk Kopi Lam Yeo.\nPada tahun-tahun awalnya, kedai Lam Yeo menawarkan 10 campuran serbuk kopi khas yang baru dikisar dan dibungkus untuk pembeli yang datang ke kedainya atau dihantar ke kopitiam (kedai kopi) di serata pulau. Tan juga menjelajahi rantau ini untuk mendapatkan biji kopi terbaik, memanggangnya dengan penuh berhati-hati dan mengadunkan hasilnya untuk menghasilkan minuman yang memikat hati peminat.\nHari ini, keturunan Tan masih menghasilkan campuran warisan kedai yang disukai oleh pelanggan lama mereka. Bagaimanapun, Lam Yeo juga mengikuti perkembangan zaman, dan kini menawarkan campuran ‘gourmet’ dari negara-negara seperti Brazil, Ethiopia dan Colombia, yang telah membantu kedai ini memikat hati generasi baru penggemar kopi.\nSenduk logam kecil ini digunakan oleh Benny Tan, cucu pengasas, untuk menyukat dan membahagi biji kopi untuk pelanggan yang datang ke kedai.\nSanjungan kepada tradisi: Kedai Roti dan Konfeksi Sweetlands\nPada tahun 1970-an, terdapat hampir 200 kedai roti tradisional di seluruh Singapura tetapi hari ini, hanya tinggal kurang daripada 10 kedai roti seperti itu. Kedai Roti dan Konfeksi Sweetlands, yang pertama kali dibuka pada tahun 1960-an, ialah salah satu kedai roti seperti itu. Ia asalnya dikenali sebagai Kedai Roti Kim Keat, dan membekalkan roti kepada kopitiam (kedai kopi) di sepanjang Balestier Road dan kawasan di luarnya.\nKetika pemilik asalnya bersara pada tahun 2001, kedai roti itu diambil alih oleh Ng Yek Heng (lahir 1956) yang mengubah namanya menjadi Sweetlands. Di bawah pengurusan Ng, kedai roti itu mengembangkan pelanggannya untuk merangkumi medan selera baru dan kafe moden. Kedai roti itu menghasilkan kira-kira 1,200 bantal roti, termasuk roti tradisional, roti perancis dan ban setiap hari.\nKedai roti itu begitu penuh sesak dan sibuk. Pembakar roti mesti menguli adunan sehingga tepung dan ragi sebati. Sebelum membakar, mereka mengoles minyak pada acuan dengan betul untuk memastikan adunan tidak melekat pada acuan. Mereka kemudian meletakkan acuan ke dalam ketuhar berputar besar, dan memotong dengan teliti \"kulit\" berwarna coklat (kerak keras) setiap bantal roti setelah ia dikeluarkan dari ketuhar.\nHari ini, Kedai Roti dan Konfeksi Sweetlands berada dalam tangan pemilik ketiga yang mengambil alih perniagaan berikutan persaraan Ng. Roti yang dipotong dan berbungkus yang dihasilkan di kilang-kilang besar mungkin menguasai pasaran hari ini tetapi keupayaan Sweetlands untuk terus bertahan menjadi bukti bahawa orang ramai masih menikmati roti bakar kaya mereka yang dihasilkan dengan cara tradisional.\nAcuan logam ini digunakan untuk membakar roti tradisional dan setiap acuan boleh berisi kira-kira 800-900 gram adunan yang diuli dengan baik.\nMengintai kepada masa lalu: Pusat Kaca Mata dan Kanta Lekap Lim Kay Khee\nPusat Kaca Mata dan Kanta Lekap Lim Kay Khee ialah salah satu kedai kaca mata tertua di Singapura dengan sejarah yang bermula pada tahun 1920-an. Pengasas kedai, Lim Kay Khee (1913-1988), datang ke Singapura dari China pada usia sembilan tahun dan bekerja sebagai perantis di sebuah kedai kaca mata orang Shanghai di mana beliau memperoleh kemahiran seorang pembuat kaca mata yang ulung.\nSemasa Perang Dunia II, majikan Lim telah terbunuh, tetapi beliau berjaya melarikan diri ke sebuah rumah di Tai Gin Road dengan satu set peralatan kaca mata dan buku panduan teknikal. Alat-alat ini, ditambah dengan kemahiran Lim, terbukti menjadi penyelamat. Seorang askar Jepun telah memerintahkan seorang rakan Lim supaya membelikan sepasang kaca mata. Takut nyawanya terancam, rakan ini berpaling kepada Lim, yang dapat membuat satu set yang memuaskan hati askar itu dan menyelamatkan kedua-dua lelaki itu daripada bahaya.\nPada tahun 1946, setelah Perang Dunia II berakhir, Lim menubuhkan Syarikat Perdagangan Great China, sebuah perniagaan borong yang mengimport bingkai kaca mata dan produk optik lain. Syarikat itu pada awalnya berpusat di 383 Balestier Road, tetapi pada tahun 1960, perniagaan itu berpindah ke rumah kedai ini. Pada tahun 1970-an, kedai itu diberikan nama yang ada sekarang ketika kanta lekap ditambah kepada perkhidmatannya.\nHari ini, anak-anak Lim, yang merupakan optometris diperakui di peringkat antarabangsa, terus mengendalikan dua kedai kaca mata keluarga itu di sini dan di Peninsula Plaza. Gaya kaca mata mungkin berubah mengikut zaman, tetapi kedai ini, dengan jubin lantai mozek aslinya dan carta visual dan alat kaca mata yang sudah lama digunakan, masih menawarkan pelanggan pengintaian kepada masa lalu sedang keluarga Lim meneruskan perniagaan keluarga yang bermula lebih daripada 70 tahun lalu.\nPada tahun 1960-an, ketika keupayaan membaca dan menulis orang dewasa berada di bawah 60 peratus, carta dengan piktogram ini biasanya digunakan untuk menguji ketajaman visual orang dewasa dan juga kanak-kanak yang tidak dapat membaca.\nGameOn Nila Jejak Warisan Edition\nGameOn Nila Jejak Warisan Edition\nClick here to download the app.", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/street-corner-heritage-galleries-balestier-malay", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/street-corner-heritage-galleries-balestier/stcornergalleries-balestier-e.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:30"},

A typical kendi has a bulbous body, a neck which is used for holding the vessel and a spout. The tradition of using kendi in Hindu-Buddhist rituals suggests that this type of vessel originated from India. Kendi have been used in Southeast Asia for at least a thousand years, as indicated by depictions on temple wall reliefs dating back to 9th century CE. A wide variety of kendi have been recovered from sites across Southeast Asia. They include locally made earthenware kendi as well as glazed wares from China, Japan, Thailand and Vietnam. These were part of the lively international trade in ceramics and other commodities that resulted in stylistic exchanges. For instance, the squat kendi with mammiform spout was a popular Southeast Asian form that was also made in China for export. Kendi were used for a wide range of purposes in addition to their primary function as a pouring and drinking container. In Southeast Asia, kendi were important as ritual pouring vessels used in weddings and other ceremonies. Miniature kendi were likely to have been medicine containers or toys.

Introduction\nAbout the Street Corner Heritage Galleries scheme\nThe Street Corner Heritage Galleries scheme is a collaborative effort between NHB museums, heritage institutions and community galleries, and local shop owners in their respective precincts to strengthen partnerships with communities and raise awareness of and foster deeper appreciation for heritage in everyday spaces. \nThe scheme allows NHB to work closely with local shop owners with at least 30 years of history in selected precincts to co-create “mini museums” that showcase the history and heritage of their respective businesses and trades. Located on site, these galleries will display historical documents, photographs and artefacts that tell the stories of these shops.\nOn top of providing funding, curatorial support and assistance in fabricating the showcases, NHB will also work with local shop owners to develop programmes such as talks, tours and workshops, and provide opportunities to participate in key NHB events such as the Singapore Heritage Festival and the respective CultureFests of the heritage institutions within their precincts.\n老店铺文化站：马里士他区\nGaleri Warisan Sudut Jalan: Balestier\nதெரு முனை மரபுடைமைக் காட்சிக்கூடங்கள் : பாலெஸ்தியர்\nPastries filled with history: Loong Fatt Tau Sar Piah\nThere is always a long queue at Loong Fatt as people line up for its signature tau sar piah, a traditional flaky pastry filled with mung bean (also known as green bean) paste. However, this landmark shop, which is said to be the oldest surviving traditional kopitiam (coffee shop) at Balestier Road, had its beginnings as a Western-style bakery in 1948.\nLoong Fatt’s founder, Lee Wang Long (1922-2018), arrived in Singapore from Hainan, China, and first worked as a housekeeper, where he learned to bake English-style cream puffs and other sweet confections. In 1948, he opened a bakery cum kopitiam in this single-storey shop which flourished in the 1950s and 1960s. When business declined in the 1970s, Loong Fatt turned to making tau sar piah.\nToday, Lee’s family continues to run Loong Fatt, where a team of bakers prepare 3,000-4,000 tau sar piah every day. The exact recipe is a secret, but according to Mdm Loo Suan Mui, who has worked at Loong Fatt since the 1970s, high-quality butter is added to produce a crispier crust, which differs from the softer crust of tau sar piah made in the traditional Teochew style.\nThe shop has been renovated a few times over the years, but its original green and white wall tiles as well as some of the wooden benches and tables have been retained. Tradition, it seems, is never out of style at Loong Fatt, which still draws in the crowds who come for a hearty meal and often leave with a box or more of tau sar piah fresh from its ovens.\nThese metal cups were formerly used to make butter cakes. \n  This wooden rolling pin was used to knead dough, after which a sweet or savoury filling is added, and the mix placed into the oven for baking. \nFrom market stall to restaurant: Loy Kee Best Chicken Rice\nFor more than 25 years, people have flocked to this corner shop to dine on succulent chicken and fragrant rice, spiced with hand ground ginger and a homemade garlic-chilli dip. However, few may be aware that Loy Kee has been selling traditional Hainanese chicken rice in the Balestier area since 1953.\nLoy Kee’s founder, Loy Nie In (1920-2007), came to Singapore from Hainan in the 1940s and his wife, Qua Tee, joined him in Singapore subsequently. In 1953, the Loys opened a little stall selling Hainanese chicken rice as well as chicken and pork porridge at Rayman Market (now Whampoa Makan Place), near a newly built Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) housing estate called Rayman Estate.\nBusiness was good but it was backbreaking work for the Loy family. James Loy, the Loys’ youngest son, recalled that his parents would often sleep over in the market stall as they needed to boil porridge and prepare chicken for residents wanting a hearty breakfast early in the morning. The Loys continued to do well in the 1970s, when Rayman Estate was redeveloped into a Housing & Development Board estate.\nIn the 1980s, the Loys retired and handed down their business to their children. Today, Loy Sai Hong, their elder son, continues to run the family’s chicken rice stall at Whampoa Makan Place. Meanwhile, James, the younger son, took over this former kopitiam (coffee shop) and converted it into Loy Kee Best Chicken Rice in 1994.\nLoy Nie In and Qua Tee used these choppers to portion out chicken for their customers. The larger chopper (below) was used by Loy, while the smaller chopper was used by his wife. \nTaste of the “South Sea”: Lam Yeo Coffee Powder Factory\nSince 1960, when Tan Thian Kang (1912-2008) opened this shop, fans of good local coffee have been making a beeline for Lam Yeo’s coffee beans. “Lam Yeo” is a Hokkien dialect term for “Nanyang” or “South Sea”, which refers to Southeast Asia. Tan chose to name his shop after this evocative term, as he had worked as an assistant editor at Nanyang Siang Pau, a prominent Chinese-language newspaper, in the 1950s.\nTan’s move from newsprint to coffee powder began in 1959, after a brief stint as a salesman for a coffee factory. He started off hawking handpicked coffee beans door to door from the back of a van. As his business grew, Tan and his wife Lim Chok Tee set up shop in 1960 as Lam Yeo Coffee Powder Factory.\nDuring its early years, Lam Yeo’s shopfront offered 10 signature blends of coffee powder that were freshly ground and packed for walk-in buyers or delivered to kopitiams (coffee shops) all over the island. Tan also scoured the region for the finest coffee beans, roasting them with painstaking care and blending the results to create brews that won over fans.\nToday, Tan’s descendants still serve up the shop’s legacy blends favoured by their long-time customers. However, Lam Yeo has also kept up with the times, and now offers gourmet blends from countries such as Brazil, Ethiopia and Colombia, which have helped the shop win over a new generation of coffee lovers.\nThis small metal scoop is used by Benny Tan, the founder’s grandson, to measure and portion out coffee beans for walk-in customers.\nToast to tradition: Sweetlands Bread & Bakery\nIn the 1970s, there were nearly 200 traditional bakeries all over Singapore but today, less than 10 such bakeries remain. Sweetlands Bread & Bakery, which first opened in the 1960s, is one such bakery. It was originally known as Kim Keat Bakery, and supplied loaves to kopitiams (coffee shops) along Balestier Road and beyond.\nWhen the original owners retired in 2001, the bakery was taken over by Ng Yek Heng (b. 1956), who renamed it Sweetlands. Under Ng’s management, the bakery expanded its clientele to include new food courts and modern cafés. The bakery produces an estimated 1,200 pieces of bread, including traditional loaves, baguettes and buns, daily.\nThe shop floor of the bakery is a hive of activity. The bakers must knead the dough thoroughly so that the flour and yeast are evenly distributed. Before baking, they grease the baking pans properly to ensure that the dough does not stick to the pans. They then place the pans into a large rotating oven, and carefully slice off the brown “skin” (hard crust) of each loaf after it emerges from the oven.\nToday, Sweetlands Bread & Bakery is in the hands of a third owner, who took over the business following Ng’s retirement. Packaged sliced bread manufactured in large factories may dominate the market today but Sweetlands’ ability to sustain itself is proof indeed that people still enjoy their kaya toast made the traditional way.\nThese metal pans are used for baking traditional bread loaves and each pan can contain an estimated 800-900 grams of well-kneaded dough. \nA peek into the past: Lim Kay Khee Optical and Contact Lens Centre\nLim Kay Khee Optical and Contact Lens Centre is one of the oldest optical shops in Singapore with a history that goes back to the 1920s. The shop’s founder, Lim Kay Khee (1913-1988), came to Singapore from China at the tender age of nine, and worked as an apprentice at a Shanghainese optical shop where he acquired the skills of a master spectacle maker.\nDuring World War II, Lim’s employers were killed, but he managed to escape to a house in Tai Gin Road with a set of optical equipment and technical manuals. These tools, coupled with Lim’s skills, proved to be a lifeline. A Japanese soldier had ordered a friend of Lim to procure a pair of glasses. Fearing for his life, this friend turned to Lim, who was able to craft a set that satisfied the soldier and saved both men from harm.\nIn 1946, after World War II ended, Lim set up Great China Trading Company, a wholesale business that imported spectacle frames and other optical products. The company was originally based at 383 Balestier Road, but in 1960, the business relocated to this shophouse. The shop was given its present name in the 1970s, when contact lenses were added to its offerings.\nToday, Lim’s children, who are internationally certified optometrists, continue to run the family’s two optical shops here and at Peninsula Plaza. Eyewear styles may change with the times, but this shop, with its original mosaic floor tiles and well-used visual charts and optical tools, still offers customers a peek into the past as the Lims continue a family trade that began more than 70 years ago.\nGameOn Nila Jejak Warisan Edition\nClick here to download the app.\n\nDuring the 1960s, when adult literacy was below 60 per cent, this chart with pictograms was commonly used to test the visual acuity of adults as well as children who could not read. \nGameOn Nila Jejak Warisan Edition\nGameOn Nila Jejak Warisan Edition\nClick here to download the app.", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/street-corner-heritage-galleries-balestier", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/street-corner-heritage-galleries-balestier/stcornergalleries-balestier-e.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:31"},

Risking life and limb, immigrants, eager to leave behind impoverished circumstances, embarked on perilous journeys in overcrowded junks for a fresh start in Singapore. Many of the vessels they came on would have docked along Telok Ayer’s seafront.\nUpon setting foot on shore, looking for accomodation and job matching assistance would have been a priority, however the religious among them would have likely made a first stop at the makeshift shrines along the waterfront to give thanks for safe passage.\nA lithograph of Thian Hock Keng and early settlers along Telok Ayer Street.

Its beach was a hive of shipbuilding activity with workers repairing vessels and piecing together tongkangs (light wooden boats).1 (Image from the Singapore Philatelic Museum)\nLife was pretty rough for immigrants. Telok Ayer itself, which was generally occupied by the Chinese as per the design of the Raffles Town Plan of 1822, soon became overcrowded and a hub for the slave trade.2\nThe British made some adjustments to the site beginning in the late 1800s via reclamation works which pushed Telok Ayer Street four streets away from the seafront. Cecil Street, Robinson Road and Shenton Way were subsequently built on the reclaimed land.\nEven more has changed since then, with the area now home to skyscrapers and modern buildings. Despite these sweeping changes, the imprint of Singapore’s early immigrants still exists in the form of six historic buildings: the Thian Hock Keng temple, Singapore Yu Huang Gong, Ying Fo Fui Kun, the Al-Abrar Mosque, Nagore Dargah and the Telok Ayer Methodist Church. The National Heritage Board gazetted these as national monuments between the years 1973 and 2009, and they remain as tangible representations of our forebears' fears, hopes and dreams.\nJoin us as we walk you through Telok Ayer’s multicultural, national gems.\nYing Fo Fui Kun, No. 98 Telok Ayer Street\nYing Fo Fui Kun, a clan association, strove to help new Hakka immigrants find accommodation and jobs in Singapore. Most Hakkas worked as woodcutters and carpenters as well as blacksmiths and goldsmiths.\nEstablished in 1822, just three years after Stamford Raffles landed, this cosy, two-storey clan provided Hakka settlers with job matching services and temporary respite3 after the long journey at sea.\nIts name reflects its founders’ desire for peaceful coexistence among the Hakkas of Singapore4 — the fourth largest Chinese dialect group. The late founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, as well as the Aw brothers of Tiger Balm fame, are among some of Singapore’s most well-known Hakkas.\nThe monument’s appearance resembles clan-temple buildings common in the southeastern coastal region of Guangdong, China. As you walk by, take note of the windows along its facade for they have been positioned pretty high off the ground to discourage intruders.\nNagore Dargah Indian-Muslim Heritage Centre, No. 140 Telok Ayer Street\nNagore Durgha when it served as a shrine. It was repurporsed into an Indian-Muslim Heritage Centre in 2011. Its distinct fluted Corinthian pillars set it apart from its neighbours. (Image from the National Museum of Singapore)\nWalk a little further down the street and you’ll be greeted by the peach and white limestone Nagore Dargah Indian-Muslim Heritage Centre — a replica of an Indian shrine in Tamil Nadu devoted to 13th century Muslim saint Shahul Hamid who was known for his ability to protect sailors and seafarers.\nSeeking a new life, Chulia immigrants who worked primarily as traders and money changers, left their homes along the windswept Coromandel Coast in southern India for Singapore. Before embarking on the long voyage, they visited the saint’s shrine in the town of Nagore to pray for safe passage.\nThe Chulias built a version of this shrine in Telok Ayer between the years 1828 and 1830. The building boasts eclectic architecture. Think Doric columns and arches as well as large French style windows.5 Look closely and you will be able to spot niches in its towers — oil lamps used to be placed in these little lots during festivals. In 2011, it was relaunched as the Nagore Dargah Indian Muslim Heritage Centre.\nSingapore Yu Huang Gong, No. 150 Telok Ayer Street\nJust a few doors down stands the former Keng Teck Whay building — the only surviving Peranakan ancestral hall and clan complex in Singapore.6 It was closed to the outside world for almost 160 years.\nCiting a common ancestry in Zhangzhou, in the Fujian Province of China,7 36 Peranakan merchants with surnames such as Ang, Chan and Yeo,8 got together to establish the private mutual aid organisation in 1831.\nThe building which served as a place to venerate their ancestors, worship the deity Sanguan Dadi,9 and conduct meetings, was completed in the late 1840s and early 1850s.10 Membership continues to be restricted to the male descendants of its founding members.11\nThe Keng Teck Whay brotherhood relocated to Changi in 2010 following the structure’s gazette as a national monument the year before.12 The Taoist Mission (Singapore) acquired it in 2010 and oversaw an elaborate $3.8 million restoration project. The building now bears a new name — the Singapore Yu Huang Gong and is dedicated to the worship of the Heavenly Jade Emperor. It is open to all. While there, keep a look out for delicately crafted sculptures and carvings of dragons, fish and flowers on its roofs.\nThian Hock Keng, No. 158 Telok Ayer Street\nPhotographic studio G.R. Lambert & Co.’s albumen print of the Thian Hock Keng Temple (Temple of Heavenly Happiness) at Telok Ayer Street in the 1880s. Constructed between 1839 and 1842, the temple is dedicated to Mazu, a deity widely regarded as the goddess of the sea. The temple, one of the oldest places of worship in Singapore, was designated a national monument in 1973. (Image from the National Museum of Singapore)\nAfter a long journey by sea, weary travellers of yesteryear were said to have made their way through Thian Hock Keng’s incense-filled halls to offer thanks to Mazu, a goddess known for her ability to protect seafarers.\nLikely the oldest Hokkien temple in the country, Thian Hock Keng at 158 Telok Ayer Street started life as a small shrine for Mazu. It was rebuilt between 1839 and 1842 with the donations of owners and sailors of Chinese junks at the harbour, as well as Hokkien merchants and community leaders.\nEngravings of bats, in the corners of carved stone windows along the temple’s facade, represent luck and prosperity.\nInside, a wooden plaque inscribed with Chinese characters which mean “gentle waves over the South Seas” — a blessing for safe passage from Emperor Guangxu of Qing China — takes pride of place above the temple’s main altar.13\nOnce a year, Thian Hock Keng organises a rambunctious procession known as the Excursion of Peace where a sedan chair ferrying the image of Mazu is paraded through the historic streets of Telok Ayer before proceeding to board a ferry at Marina South Pier to bless the sea.\nThe temple was refreshed in a major restoration exercise between 1988 and 2000, earning it an honourable mention at the UNESCO Asia-Pacific Heritage Awards for Cultural Heritage Conservation in 2001.\nAl-Abrar Mosque, No. 192 Telok Ayer Street\nThe Al-Abrar Mosque which faces Mecca, was established in 1827 as a thatched hut which explains its nickname — kuchu palli, or hut mosque in Tamil. Between 1850 and 1855, the hut was replaced by a brick building which still stands today albeit with some modifications.14 (c1950s. Image from the National Museum of Singapore)\nContinue along the same five-foot way and you’ll spot the Al-Abrar Mosque, also known as Masjid Chulia. The mosque was established as early as 1827 as a place of worship for Chulias or Tamil Muslims from the Coromandel Coast of southern India. It took the form of a thatched hut.\nThe mosque’s Indo-Islamic design, with features such as minarets at its entrance, stands out from the rows of shophouses lining Telok Ayer. Inside, the mosque boasts European Neoclassical design elements such as Doric columns and French louvred windows.\nThe mosque stands as a reminder of the role Chulia immigrants played in shaping Singapore as some of the colony’s early traders and money changers.\nTelok Ayer Methodist Church, No. 235 Telok Ayer Street\nThe exterior walls of Telok Ayer Methodist Church are rather thick, having been reinforced during World War II to protect hundreds seeking refuge from bullets and shrapnel. Venture inside and you might be directed to a regular looking female toilet. During the war, it served as a storeroom with a trap door for women and girls to hide from the Japanese.\nAt the end of the street stands the charmingly eclectic Telok Ayer Methodist Church building, originally founded in 1889 in a shophouse clinic owned by American Methodist missionary Dr Benjamin West.15 Dr West had a heart for the Chinese community and his parishioners included patients recovering from opium addiction.16\nThe church moved to its present day location in 1925. To reflect the make-up of its early congregation, a Chinese-style pavilion roof was installed.\nNotes", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/telok-ayer/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/telok-ayer-street-of-diversity/a-view-of-telok-ayer-bay.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:32"},

Text by Lucille Yap\nBe Muse Volume 7 Issue 1 – Jan to Mar 2014\nIf you think stamps are boring – here’s an exhibition that will not only change the way you look at – but smell, hear, touch, and yes – taste them.\nBut first, a little history: Postage stamps were introduced by Englishman, Sir Rowland Hill, in 1840 as a form of prepayment for postal delivery service. It was one of the most important inventions of the 19th century as stamps provided a cheap means of sending letters and paved the way for mass communication. Since then, the role of postage stamps has evolved. Stamps today are used to document a country’s historical milestones, achievements, aspirations, arts, culture, and biodiversity. The wealth of information encapsulated in these miniature pieces of art are collected and studied as a hobby by many.\nIn today’s IT age, postal communication remains vital, especially with the popularity of internet shopping. In the spirit of innovation, philately – the study of stamps and postal history – has kept up with the times. Postal authorities court buyers by using technological advancements to produce dazzling arrays of stamps; advanced printing technology and innovative printing techniques allow stamp designers to express their creativity. Much to the delight of users and collectors, some stamps these days are designed and printed on non-paper materials and incorporated with interesting and quirky features that bring out their beauty.\nSome of these were on display at the Singapore Philatelic Museum in 2014 – many for the first time. Spanning over 47 years of collection, the exhibition which featured more than 300 unique stamps not only bucked traditional expectations that stamps are always and only printed on paper – they even tickle one’s senses of sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch!\nIt is simply a visual treat to see stamps bejewelled with precious stones like diamond, crystal and gem; and precious metals like gold, silver and bronze.\nSwarovski Crystals, Austria, 2008.\nExhibit from Singapore Philatelic Museum Collection.\nThere are also stamps that are made of unusual materials such as lace, cork, wood, and embedded with real pearl, sea salt and volcanic ash. Some can even glow in the dark or feature 3-D moving images, while others smell of coffee, chocolate, fruits and flowers.\nIf this is not fascinating enough, there are even talking stamps that narrate poems and play folk songs, and DVD stamps that show videos of the country. To top it all, there are stamps that taste of the food they depict when being licked!\nPrecious Stone\nSpecial techniques and glues are used to affix diamonds and crystals onto the stamps. These precious stones must be firmly and securely adhered to the stamps to survive the postal system if they are used on mail.\nUEFA EURO 2008, Austria, 2008\nExhibit from Singapore Philatelic Museum Collection\nFour crystals decorated the stamp featuring the Henri Delaunay Cup for UEFA EURO 2008.\nQueen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee, Jersey, 2012\nExhibit on Loan from Cartor Security Printing.\nA genuine 1.25mm hand-cut diamond is affixed on the crown worn by Queen Elizabeth II on the miniature sheet. The Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in 2012 marked 60 years of her reign.\nPrecious Metal\nGenuine 22- and 24-carat gold, silver, bronze and platinum are some of the precious metals used to produce some of the stamps on display. They are either in the form of solid metal similar to ingots, or in the form of foils that are pressed onto the printed stamp surfaces using a combination of heat and pressure.\nYear of the Snake, Hong Kong, 2013\nExhibit from Singapore Philatelic Museum Collection\nThe Snake on the “Gold and Silver Stamp Sheetlet on Lunar New Year Dragon/Snake” issued by Hong Kong Post is affixed with 22K gold-plated lace metal. It is considered a world-first for the application of 22K gold-plated lace metal to a postage stamp.\nPope John Paul II, Vatican City, 2003\nExhibit from Singapore Philatelic Museum Collection\nThe Pope was honoured by Vatican City in the form of genuine silver ingot.\nOsaka 70, Gabon, 1970\nExhibit from Singapore Philatelic Museum Collection\nThe entire stamp is embossed on gold foil, featuring the stamp exhibition held in Osaka, Japan, in 1970.\nUnusual Materials\nFootball Material\nEURO 2008 Football Championship, Austria, 2008\nExhibit from Singapore Philatelic Museum Collection\nThe stamp is made of synthetic material used for the outer surface of footballs. The football championship was held in Austria and Switzerland in 2008.\nEmbroidery\nEmbroidery Stamps Series 1, 2 and 3. Austria, 2005, 2007 and 2010\nExhibit from Singapore Philatelic Museum Collection\nThis series of embroidery stamps is created in Lustenau, the centre of the Vorarlberg embroidery industry by Austrian embroiderer Häemmerle and Vogel. The first two issues are entirely embroidered while the third issue is affixed with an embroidered rose – meticulously pasted by hand.\nCork Material\nCork Tree, Portugal, 2007\nExhibit from Singapore Philatelic Museum Collection\nThis stamp features a cork tree and is made from wafer-thin “paper cork” with a thickness of just 0.35mm. Portugal is the world’s biggest producer of cork.\nFir Tree Wood\nSwiss Wood - Naturally Switzerland\nExhibit from Singapore Philatelic Museum Collection\nThe trees used to produce the stamps were about 120 years old, and come from the Aargau municipalities of Seon and Staufen in Switzerland.\nLace\nSt Gallen Embroided Lace, Switzerland, 2000\nExhibit from Singapore Philatelic Museum Collection\nThis stamp is made entirely of lace which was made exclusively for its issue. The lace is embroidered using polyester thread on a high-quality, satin-weave, polyester base.\nFlock\nFlock material used on these stamps is produced through a special process. Very fine cellulose fibres with special gum are sprayed onto the stamp paper to create a soft, smooth textured feel to the surface. It has a velvety, fabric-like finish.\nSilk\nRoyal Thai Silk, Thailand, 2010\nLimited Edition of Miniature Sheet on Loan from Cartor Security Printing\nQueen Sirikit’s 78th birthday was celebrated with this issue of silk stamps. The Royal Peacock emblem was granted by the Queen as a quality guarantee for the silk. 15,000 sets of stamps were handmade from about 6,000 metres of silk.\nQuirky Features\nPearl\nPearl Diving Tools, Saudi Arabia, 2005\nExhibit from Singapore Philatelic Museum Collection\nHalf a pearl is affixed onto the bottom left-hand corner of each stamp.\nBeaded Stamp\nPeranakan Museum Collection, Singapore, 2008\nExhibit from Singapore Philatelic Museum Collection\nThe world’s first beaded stamp is designed in a unique pouch shape, and is intricately pasted by hand with caviar beads.

The stamps will gradually decompose in the soil, and provide protective mulch for the seedling.\nThe seed of the indigenous Ghaf tree is covered in the tree fibre and affixed onto one of the two stamps. The Ghaf tree is an integral part of the United Arab Emirates’ environment and heritage.\nTo commemorate 50 years of Singapore’s green movement, the $5 stamp is embedded with the seeds of Portulaca grandiflora – a flowering plant once popular among many Singaporeans.\nStamps with Aroma and Taste\nScented stamps can be created by using different techniques. One uses the micro-encapsulation of small amounts of perfume; scent is released when the surface is gently rubbed. Another method is to add scented essence to the varnish that coats the surface of the stamps.\nSome scented stamps also come with flavours! Food essence is added to the glue before being applied to the back of the stamp, so that users who lick the stamps will taste the food.\nBelgian Chocolate, Belgium, 2013\nExhibit from Singapore Philatelic Museum Collection\nThe five stamps depict chocolate in various forms: sprinkles, pralines, chocolate spread, pieces of raw chocolate and bars. These stamps taste and smell of dark chocolate. Cocoa-oil is added to the gum to give it even more flavour.\nAction Stamps\nEURO 2008 Football Championship, Austria, 2008\nExhibit from Singapore Philatelic Museum Collection\nThis stamp shows the legendary goal scored by Andi Herzog, Austria’s record-breaking international player. 48 frames of images taken from television recordings are put together to produce this three-second dynamic and fluid action. <\nScan & Watch\nKunqu Opera, China, 2010\nExhibit from Singapore Philatelic Museum Collection\nWatch a Kunqu Opera performance by scanning these stamps.

The use of archaic wares continued during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). The fashion for archaism was revived again during the reign of Qianlong (1736–1795) when catalogues of the Imperial art collections inspired the production of all sorts of arts and crafts in ancient styles.Dehua, located on the southeast coast of Fujian province, is well known for its production of white porcelain, known to Europeans as 'blanc de Chine'.

Location\nNational Monuments sksks\n30B Philip Street, Singapore 048696\nGet Directions\nDwarfed by modern skyscrapers in the heart of the Central Business District is one of Singapore’s oldest Chinese temples, Yueh Hai Ching Temple (粤海清庙). Also known as Wak Hai Cheng Bio in Teochew, the temple serves as a reminder of the contributions of Teochew Chinese pioneers who arrived in Singapore shortly after the arrival of the British in 1819.\nTeochew Temple\nTeochew immigrants hailed from the Chaoshan region in South China, located in the easternmost Guangdong Province and bordering Fujian Province. When they first arrived in Singapore, the Teochew immigrants set up a small wood-and-attap shrine on what is known as Philip Street today, and offered prayers in thanksgiving to Mazu (妈祖), Goddess of the Seas, for her protection and blessings during the treacherous sea voyages from China. This explains the name of the temple, which in English means ‘Temple of the Calm Sea of the Guangdong (Yue) People’. It is believed that a man named Lin Pan (林泮) built a proper temple on the site of the makeshift shrine in 1826. Like other places of worship in Singapore, the temple also functioned as a social centre for immigrants.\nNgee Ann Kongsi (义安公司), which was established in 1845 to look after the religious needs and welfare of the Teochew community in Singapore, took over the management of the temple the same year. During its incipient years, the Kongsi was led by Seah Eu Chin (佘有进), a wealthy Teochew pepper and gambier merchant. Yueh Hai Ching Temple was subsequently rebuilt between 1852 and 1855 with funds collected from the growing Teochew community in Singapore. Some building materials were specially imported from China.\nDeities\nThe temple now comprises two prayer halls: the left wing of the temple, Tian Hou Gong (天后宫, ‘Palace of the Heavenly Empress’), is reserved for the worship of Mazu; Shang Di Gong (上帝宫, ‘Palace of the Heavenly Emperor’) on the right is where the faithful honour Xuan Tian Shang Di (玄天上帝, ‘Heavenly Emperor’), the patron deity of the Teochews. As both prayer halls look identical, Cantonese devotees nicknamed the temple Mah Miu (孖庙), which means ‘Twin Temples’.\nArchitecture and Furnishings\nYueh Hai Ching Temple was built in the standard three-hall layout of traditional Chinese temples, with covered courtyards between the entrance and main halls. Its Teochew-style roof has a relatively straight ridge. An outstanding feature is the set of delightful three-dimensional sculptures on its roof, which depict scenes of towns in China, as well as mythical flora and fauna that represent longevity, posterity, and strength.\nThe exquisite images of dragons and other ornamentation on the temple’s roofscape are crafted using a special method known in Guangdong as qian ci (嵌瓷). This technique is commonly called jian nian (剪粘), which literally means ‘cut and paste’. Colourful ceramics were carefully cut and trimmed into smaller pieces, and then pasted to create beautiful mosaic figures. Such decorations can also be found on the roofscapes of Former House of Tan Yeok Nee, Thian Hock Keng, Former Keng Teck Whay Building, Hong San See, and Lian Shan Shuang Lin Monastery.\nThe temple’s interior is replete with intricate carvings depicting scenes from popular Chinese legends and folklore, including ‘Eight Immortals Crossing the Seas’ (八仙过海), ‘Ruse of the Empty City’ (空城计), and ‘Madam White Snake Steals Lingzhi Grass to Save Xu Xian’ (白素贞偷灵芝草救许仙).\nIn 1899, Emperor Guangxu of Qing China bestowed Yueh Hai Ching Temple with a scroll on which four calligraphic characters – shu hai xiang yun (曙海祥云) – were elegantly written in his own hand. The phrase can be translated as ‘moving seas with peaceful clouds above’; it conveyed the Emperor’s blessings to the local Chinese community, in return for the temple’s contribution of 6,000 taels of silver for the flood relief efforts in Shandong, China. The four characters were carved on a large wooden plaque, which is now prominently displayed in the temple. Besides Yueh Hai Ching Temple, the only other temple in Singapore to have received a similar imperial favour is Thian Hock Keng.\nYueh Hai Ching Temple Today\nYueh Hai Ching Temple underwent extensive restoration between 2011 and 2014. This won the temple the Award of Merit in the UNESCO Asia-Pacific Heritage Awards for Cultural Heritage Conservation in 2014.\nPuppet shows are still performed at the temple in honour of the deities on certain festivals.

A loyal Chinese patriot and freedom fighter, he sacrificed his life at a young age of 35 during the war. TL;DR\nLim Bo Seng (27 April 1909–29 June 1944) might have been tortured by the Japanese for days on end, but it was having to leave his family behind for their own safety that tore at the heart and spirit of the father of eight.\nPortrait of Lim Bo Seng (c1941–1944. Image from the Lim Leong Geok Collection, National Archives of Singapore)\nLim Bo Seng, the first son of contractor Lim Loh, was born in a 99-room family housing complex in Fujian’s Nan’an County in China.1 He left for Singapore at 16 and studied at the prestigious Raffles Institution2 where he was classmates with individuals such as Yusof Ishak, the future president of Singapore.3\nIn 1929, Lim cut short his studies at the University of Hong Kong to take over his father’s businesses, one of which was a well-known construction company involved in the erection of major landmarks such as Goodwood Park Hotel, Victoria Memorial Hall and Old Parliament House.4 Lim’s business acumen put him in good stead to manage and grow his father’s businesses. As a result he also became a prominent merchant.5 On top of this, Lim served in key positions in a number of associations such as the Singapore Contractors Association, the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Singapore Hokkien Association.6\nLim married teacher Gan Choo Neo in 1930.7 She bore him eight children, one of whom died at a young age.8 He was a loving father, taking his children to High Street on weekends to read and buy books at Ensign Bookshop before adjourning to Polar Cafe for cake and ice cream.9\nWhen war broke out in China, Lim stepped forward and took on an active role in resisting Japanese advances, earning himself a distinguished place in history as one of Malaya’s foremost war heroes. But his anti-war efforts required great sacrifice. When Singapore fell to the Japanese, Lim found himself having little choice but to separate from his beloved family.\nClandestine missions\nLim’s anti-war efforts, where he organised fundraisers and protests, began in the 1930s, before the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese war.\nIn December 1941, Japanese troops infiltrated Kota Bharu in Malaya in an amphibious attack. Alarmed, the British called on Lim to help bolster Singapore’s defence infrastructure. As head of Labour Services of the Overseas Chinese Mobilisation Council, he gathered 10,000 men to erect defences, run key services for the population, and blow up the Causeway — a means in which the Japanese could storm Singapore.\nWith the Japanese on Singapore’s doorstep, arrangements were made for Lim and his family to leave for their safety. However, with the Japanese sinking evacuating vessels, Lim made the call to have them stay on in Singapore, choosing instead to leave their side.\nIn a diary entry dated 11 February 1942, just days before the fall of Singapore, Lim wrote that the decision to separate pained him greatly. “To leave the dear Mrs behind at the mercy of the enemy would go very hard against my own conscience. On the other hand, to remain with the family in the event of enemy occupation, would not in any way improve the situation but my presence may even make their lot very much harder.”\nHe added that his children were \"too stupefied to realise what was happening” as they kissed him goodbye. “I shall never forget the tear-stained faces as long as I live. If there is anything I could do to make up for what they were then going through, I shall not spare myself to carry it out.” It was the last time he would see them. .\nLim left soon after by sampan, observing in his diary that the sky was lit up by enemy fire in three directions — Pasir Panjang, Serangoon and Bukit Timah.10 By morning, Singapore was “enveloped in a pall of smoke”.\nLim eventually found his way to India, joining Force 136, a secret service unit established by the British and Chinese governments to recapture Singapore.11 He was responsible for recruiting Chinese espionage agents who could blend in with locals to gather intelligence.12\nUpon completion of their training, teams from Force 136 boarded a Dutch submarine from Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to re-enter the Japanese controlled territory of Malaya.13 Lim was among them. While in Malaya, Force 136 attempted to collaborate with the area’s main resistance movement, the Malayan People’s Anti-Japanese Army. It also set up a covert network to gather intelligence.14\nLater, following some blunders and a betrayal, information was divulged to the Japanese which led to the arrests of Force 136 agents. Lim, who had left the group’s Bukit Bidor camp to raise funds and expand its intelligence network, was also arrested.15\nLim was mercilessly starved and tortured for information by Japanese military police at the Batu Gajah Gaol where he was incarcerated. They failed to break him. Despite his own plight, Lim shared his meagre food rations with fellow prisoners. Compatriots who witnessed his last days in prison said he had been \"reduced to a bag of bones\".16 He eventually died of malnutrition, dysentery and torture at 35.17 Wrapped in a tattered blanket, he was taken away in a wooden cart and buried in a mass grave near the prison grounds.18\nA hero’s return\nIn Singapore, the Japanese who were baying for blood, were successful in hunting down and killing eight of Lim’s relatives living at 855 Serangoon Road — a compound comprising three houses built by Lim Loh.19 Lim’s wife, however, managed to outwit them, moving her family from one hideout to another. At one point, she even sought refuge at St John’s Island.20\nFollowing his unceremonious burial in Batu Gajah, Lim’s remains were brought back to Singapore.21 After a funeral at City Hall, he was laid to rest with full military honours on a hill overlooking MacRitchie Reservoir where he used to court his wife.22 He was posthumously awarded the rank of major-general by the Chinese Nationalist government in 1946.\nLim Bo Seng's wife Gan Choo Neo on the far right in black during his funeral service at Macritchie Reservoir. (Image from the Tham Sien Yen Collection courtesy of the National Archives of Singapore)\nOn the 10th anniversary of his death, a memorial built in his honour was unveiled at Esplanade Park. It is the only World War II memorial in Singapore dedicated to an individual. It was gazetted a national monument in 2010 alongside two other structures in the park.\nIn 2016, Lim’s personal diary which he left behind for his heartbroken wife, resurfaced. One entry reads: “You must not grieve for me. On the other hand, you should take pride in my sacrifice and devote yourself to the upbringing of the children. Tell them what happened to me and direct them along my footsteps.”\nLim Bo Seng’s grave at Macritchie Reservoir (c1946–1959.

The shophouses were re-numbered in 1930 and given their current unit numbers (202, 204, 206, 208, 210 and 212).\nAmongst them is 212 South Bridge Road (formerly 172 South Bridge Road), which housed Singapore’s first Chinese bookstore, The Commercial Press. Chinese schools in Singapore and Malaya began to flourish after the establishment of the Republic of China in 1911. Although based in China, The Commercial Press was quick to notice the demand for updated textbooks in Southeast Asia. Singapore was chosen as the first stop in their overseas expansion.\nIn 1912, The Commercial Press engaged Cao Wan Feng National Products Company as its local distributor — to test the market’s reception of its products. Besides publications of The Commercial Press, the distributor also carried publications from other bookstores, and was one of the two distributors in Nanyang for the Chinese ideological magazine, La Jeunesse.\nTo meet the increasing demand for new local textbooks, The Commercial Press decided to set up its first overseas outlet in 1915. It opened on 27 March 1916, according to a notice published in the Cheng Nam Jit Poh newspaper (振南日报), and distributed many textbooks from China. It came to be known as one of the ‘big four’ Chinese booksellers, together with The Shanghai Book Company, The World Book Company, and Chung Hwa Book Company.\nThe Commercial Press and Chung Hwa Book Company were arch rivals, as both made their profits from the sale of textbooks. The two companies would compete to make all the necessary arrangements for teachers from China to secure teaching posts in Singapore. All these arrangements were made in the hope that these teachers would use their specific textbooks when they began teaching.\nAs clanship was very strong at the time, immigrants tended to visit the specific bookshop managed by their compatriots. The staff of The Commercial Press and Chung Hwa Bookshop were from the Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces, respectively.\nTo consolidate textbook publishing, The Commercial Press merged with Chung Hwa Book Company in 1957 and became the Singapore Educational Suppliers Company. The last physical storefront of The Commercial Press closed its doors in 2012, but it continues to operate online.

At the factory, they met with General Tomoyuki Yamashita of the Japanese Imperial Army to sign the surrender document.\nSurrendering at the Ford Factory\nNational Museum of Singapore Collection.\nLocated in Upper Bukit Timah Road, the factory was Ford’s first motorcar assembly plant in Southeast Asia, completed just the year before. General Yamashita took over the premise and turned it into a Japanese headquarters, where he awaited Lieutenant-General Percival’s arrival on the morning of 15 February 1942. The factory formed the setting for the British surrender, which marked the start of the Japanese Occupation that lasted three years and seven months.\nToday, the Ford Factory is one of Singapore’s national monuments. These national monuments are gazetted for their architectural and historic significance. While Singapore’s monuments are in pristine condition today, they too have witnessed the country’s darker moments as Syonan-to.\nThis article looks at a number of monuments where wartime events took place at different stages of Singapore’s history as Syonan-to, and how they now serve as landmarks of memories in the country’s ever-changing landscape.\nLead-up to the fall of Singapore\nJust two months before the fall of Singapore, the Japanese struck seven locations in the Asia-Pacific region during the wee hours of 8 December 1941, including Singapore. Maurice Baker, who was a student at the Raffles College then, recalled that he was awakened in his hostel by bomb explosions, anti-aircraft guns and sirens from the air-raid alarm. Shortly thereafter, he and his classmates received news from his principal, Professor of History W. E. Dyer, that war in the Pacific had started and Japanese airplanes would strike again. Notwithstanding the grim future, Professor Dyer urged his students to act with great compassion towards the less fortunate. Together, they organised the Raffles College Medical Auxiliary Service, bringing medical volunteers to serve in disaster areas while the college became a makeshift hospital for the wounded.\nRaffles College was one of the buildings that were used for new purposes during wartime to serve people in that time of need, and Professor Dyer’s spirit of compassion was echoed elsewhere. As air raids intensified and soldiers started retreating from Malaya into Singapore, several other makeshift hospitals emerged to help existing hospitals cope with the increasing number of wounded. Such makeshift hospitals in the city included the St Andrew’s Cathedral, Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall and the St Joseph’s Institution. While these buildings were not designed to house hospital beds and operating theatres, the medical volunteers made do with the spaces and replaced the existing furniture, swiftly transforming them into hospitals. Today, although pews have long since replaced the beds at St Andrew’s Cathedral, history is memorialised in the plaques dedicated to servicemen who perished in the Second World War, as well as the First. The extension of the church’s north transept in 1952 also became known as the War Memorial Wing.\nNearby, one of Singapore’s biggest pre-war structures, the Municipal Building (the former City Hall), took in people who needed shelter from the ongoing air raids8. Constructed between 1926 and 1929, the building was designed with a long frontage made up of 18 colossal columns. This was to reflect the colonial rule’s strength and the Municipal Council’s important functions, which had expanded significantly in the 1920s. During air raids, the building’s large size and thick walls could provide people with adequate protection from the blasts. The Municipal Council recognised this, and also created additional shelter for another 150 people within the building by cutting into the rear of the building’s main stairway facing St Andrew’s Road.\nPeople also sought shelter and solace in places of worship amid the chaos. These places provided both spiritual help and physical protection to the people, who held on to the hope that Japanese troops would not wreak havoc in these religious places and they would hence be safe. In fact, Japanese troops did receive instructions to leave religious organisations alone. In Kampong Glam, people who lived in villages around the Sultan Mosque – both Malays and non-Malays – fled to the mosque during air raids and prayed for safety there. Venerable Pu Liang opened the doors of Siong Lim Monastery in Toa Payoh, the largest monastery in Singapore and Malaya at that time, to people living in the vicinity during air raids. Likewise, Telok Ayer Chinese Methodist Church also served as a medical centre and bomb shelter. Its exterior walls facing the street were thickened and reinforced to prevent shrapnel from penetrating the church, providing protection to the wounded and others hiding there. In addition, it had a trapdoor located in its social hall, leading to a hideout where British soldiers hid when they tried to escape from Japanese troops.\nReminder of the past: thickened walls to prevent shrapnel from cutting through the walls of the Telok Ayer Chinese Methodist Church\nImage by Preservation of Monuments Board, 2010.\nSome places of worship, however, could not escape the damage and harm caused by war. For instance, the Sultan Mosque was not always trouble-free. A bomb had fallen into its compound during an air raid, damaging one of its ancillary buildings.\nAn ancillary building of the Sultan Mosque hit during an air raid.\nNational Museum of Singapore collection.\nAlthough the Japanese troops had been instructed to leave religious organisations alone, they still entered Siong Lim Monastery to capture Venerable Pu Liang and a few of his disciples in 1942, for they were keen supporters of the anti-Japanese resistance movement. Venerable Pu Liang, who came to Singapore in 1921, condemned the Japanese invasion of China in 1937 and fiercely supported the anti-Japanese movement. In the late-1930s, he donated Siong Lim Monastery’s Vesak Day monetary collection to the China Relief Fund. As the monastery’s premises were huge and Japanese troops were not supposed to enter this place of worship, anti-Japanese groups had secretly conducted trainings in the monastery. Specifically, Venerable Pu Liang permitted Allied troops to train their pilots and technicians there. He also allowed a training centre to be set up to train drivers and mechanics to ply the treacherous Burma Road into China, so as to maintain supplies for the Chinese troops. His support for the anti-Japanese movement was too great for the Japanese to ignore, resulting in his arrest in 1942.\nOn the morning of 15 February 1942, Lieutenant-General Percival and other Anglicans attended communion service at St Andrew’s Cathedral before he surrendered Singapore to the Japanese. The cathedral remained open for service throughout the Japanese Occupation, and its membership grew with more converts in that period.\nYears of fear: 16 February 1942 – 12 September 1945\nWhile people in Singapore created new purposes for existing buildings to protect lives, the Japanese occupied some of the country’s key buildings and converted them into spaces that evoked public fear. The kempeitai (military police) were housed in these buildings to keep a close watch on the people. For instance, the Hill Street Police Station built between 1934 and 1936 as a police station and barracks for the police force to ensure order in Singapore, became one of the kempeitai offices where the military police committed atrocities and tortured their victims.\nThe Japanese also used the former Cathay Building, which opened as Singapore’s first air-conditioned cinema in 1939, as an outlet for Japanese propaganda. Japanese movies and propaganda films were screened in the theatres, with rare treats of German and Italian films. As the building was designed to house offices and apartments, it was a suitable venue for the Japanese Propaganda Department, which was also the media centre for all newspapers in Singapore and Malaya. Given its prime location as a cinema which attracted movie-goers, Cathay Building and its surroundings became a good spot for the Japanese to display severed heads of looters and thieves to strike fear in people.\nCathay building\nRudy Mosbergen, a 13-year-old student then, was one witness of this gory scene:\n\"As a little boy I heard some people talking down there, they said, you know if you go to Cathay Building, there is a head chopped off. I went down to Bras Basah Road, next to Hotel Rendezvous now. And from there I could see, I looked across next to the Cathay Building, there was a table and that fellow’s head was there.\"\nEducation was disrupted. Schools were either shut down or became tools of propaganda for the Japanese. Raffles College, one of the two tertiary institutions at that time, became a medical facility and later the headquarters of the Japanese military. Chinese schools such as Tao Nan School (which houses the Peranakan Museum today) stopped functioning during the Japanese Occupation. They were targeted by the Japanese as they had supported the anti-Japanese movement, and the premises were occupied by the Japanese army. Ng Kim Hua, a student of Tao Nan School then, recounted that the Nationalists had visited Chinese schools in Singapore to recruit young men for China’s battle against the Japanese. Lin Shiping, who taught at Tao Nan School from 1939 to 1942, shared that several teachers went into hiding after the Japanese occupied Singapore in 1942. His colleagues, Wang Zhixue and Xue Fanglun, were caught and killed.\nPeranakan Museum\nEnglish schools such as St Joseph’s Institution, on the other hand, were more fortunate. They were allowed to continue functioning to serve the needs of the Japanese. St Joseph’s Institution reopened as the Bras Basah Boys’ School after serving as the Red Cross Hospital. The students’ daily tasks, however, included growing crops in the green space in front of the school during lesson time, so as to support the “Grow Your Own Food Campaign”.

While Ford Factory witnessed the beginning of the Japanese Occupation on 15 February 1942, the Municipal Building celebrated its end on 12 September 1945. This joyous occasion was widely reported in The Straits Times, marking the paper’s revival after it stopped operating on 15 February 1942. People gathered around the Municipal Building to witness the Japanese’s march to surrender.\nSpectators planted themselves at vantage points – including the base of the dome of the former Supreme Court and the roof of the Municipal Building – to witness this historic moment. The Straits Times report, “Japanese in Malaysia Surrender at Singapore” dated 13 September 19452, described this momentous event:\n\"All vantage points had their large or small groups of spectators. Any roof within was packed with Chinese, Malays and Indians determined to see this historic ceremony.\"\n\"Scene of so many important civic meetings which had produced decisions leading to the great development of Singapore in the old era, the Municipal Council chamber yesterday became a stage for a drama of the greatest historical importance.\"\nThis important event began with a formal ceremony at the Padang, followed by the solemn proceedings in the surrender chamber. Lord Louis Mountbatten, Supreme Allied Commander in Southeast Asia, inspected the parade at the Padang.\nThe Surrender Chamber in the Municipal Building.\nNational Museum of Singapore collection.\nMosquito bombers” – British combat aircrafts – flew over in salute, big Sunderland flying boats used in long-range reconnaissance and bombing missions droned over, which were then followed by Dakota transports. The Japanese representatives arrived shortly thereafter and proceeded to the Municipal Building where they waited to sign the surrender document, witnessed by several individuals including the Sultan of Johore. He shared:\n\"I have never before been so stirred. I am glad to have been there to watch these fellows sign. I am proud to have had the honour of witnessing their formal surrender.\"\nIn a matter of nine minutes, the Japanese officially surrendered, and the surrender was publicly declared by Lord Louis Mountbatten on the steps of the Municipal Building.\nVictory Day: Proclamation of Japanese Surrender before the Municipal Building, 12 September 1945.\nNational Museum of Singapore collection.\nTwenty years later in 1965, then-Premier Lee Kuan Yew broke the news of Singapore's separation from Malaysia to some heads of consulates and key civil servants in the City Hall building (renamed from Municipal Building in 1951).\nThe Municipal Building has thus witnessed Singapore’s transformation from colonial rule, to subjugation to the Japanese, to independence.\nRemembering: Monuments and Memories\nMany years on, people’s bravery and actions are remembered through stories and memorials. For instance, the iconic block with the clock tower of the Singapore General Hospital was renamed Bowyer Block in memory of John Herbert Bowyer, Chief Medical Officer of the Outram Road General Hospital. Bowyer died in Sime Road Internment Camp during the Japanese Occupation on 1 November 1944. Also, just across the Padang facing the Municipal Building stand two memorials. One is the Cenotaph, built to commemorate the war dead; while the other is the Lim Bo Seng Memorial to honour an individual.\nTwo of the Esplanade Memorials - Cenotaph and Lim Bo Seng Memorial - reminding us of the sacrifices made by individuals.\nImages by Preservation of Monuments Board, 2011.\nThe Cenotaph, unveiled on 31 March 1922 by the Prince of Wales, was erected in honour of the 124 men from Singapore who died in action during World War I. A second dedication was made between 1950 and 1951 to those who died during World War II. Unlike the first dedication, the second did not have any names because the number of war dead was overwhelming. Instead, the message “They died so we might live” was inscribed.\nJust beside the Cenotaph, the Lim Bo Seng Memorial was dedicated to Lim Bo Seng, a man who assumed leadership for anti-Japanese activities during the Second World War. Unfortunately, he perished on 29 June 1944 following his capture by the Japanese at a road checkpoint. The construction of the memorial faced much challenges as the plans for the memorial were rejected at least five times by the government. Under the Memorial Committee’s perseverance, it was finally constructed and unveiled on 29 June 1954, a decade after Lim’s passing. The committee persisted probably because it wanted future generations to know and remember the story of Lim, who could also represent other unnamed individuals who had sacrificed themselves for Singapore’s freedom.\nFoo Min Li is Manager, Preservation of Monuments Board", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/stories-they-tell-monuments-and-singapore-during-the-japanese-occupation/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/stories-they-tell-monuments-and-singapore-during-the-japanese-occupation/stories-they-tell-monuments-and-singapore-during-the-japanese-occupation-cover.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:33"},

TL;DR\nA 2021 discovery of a pair of boundary markers uncovered the true extent of prominent philanthropist Tan Kim Seng’s sweeping estate, as well as the little-known story of merchant Sim Liang Whang and his business, Teck Kee, after which a road on the fringe of Serangoon Gardens is named after.\nHistory In Plain Sight\nFor more than a century, Dover Forest hid a secret. Partially buried under a soft pile of leaves was a boundary marker linked to one of the largest swathes of land likely ever owned by a single person in modern Singapore’s history.\nIn January 2021, while out on a site visit with some members of the nature community, National Development Minister Desmond Lee stumbled upon the artefact. On closer inspection, it was clear that the moss-covered granite marker belonged to prominent merchant Tan Kim Seng for it bore his English initials, as well as the name of his family’s business in Chinese “豊興” (Hong Hin).\n\nOne of the oldest surviving personalised boundary markers likely to exist in Singapore was discovered in Dover Forest in January 2021. The 90cm long slab was covered in moss with about two-thirds of it buried. It weighs 62kg, the average weight of an adult. Its discovery serves as a tangible reminder of Tan Kim Seng’s larger-than-life presence and spirit of enterprise. It now lies in the National Heritage Board’s care.\nBoundary markers demarcate the perimeters of land owned. Its discovery thus provides concrete evidence of the scale of Tan’s estate, depicted on a 1885 map.\nLikely purchased by Tan as an investment in 18621, researchers ascertained that the estate stretched from present-day Clementi Avenue 2 in the west to Dawson Road in the east, and also encompassed the area beginning at the School of Science and Technology — a specialised independent secondary school in the north, all the way down to Southern Kent Ridge Park in the south.\nTo put it simply, Tan’s estate ran the length of more than four MRT stations beginning at Queenstown, passing through Commonwealth and Buona Vista, and ending after Dover, en-route to Clementi. \nWatch: The Story of Tan Kim Seng's Hong Hin Marker\nVivienne Tan, who published a book about Tan Kim Seng, her husband's ancestor, shares about the family's delight upon learning about the existence of the boundary marker. Meanwhile, map research consultant Mok Ly Yng weighs in on its significance.\n\nThe substantial area Tan Kim Seng owned in southwestern Singapore during the 19th century which is now home to educational campuses such as the National University of Singapore and Singapore Polytechnic, as well as a part of the Southern Ridges, one-north, and Queensway. The marker, depicted by the cross above, delineates the northernmost frontier of Tan’s estate which was once planted with rubber and coconut trees.

Tan’s empire also comprised mansions, warehouses, and a slew of other properties. Collection of the Asian Civilisations Museum.\nThe estate, much of which was uncultivated, was handed over to the colonial government in 1947 by Tan's great-great grandson Eng Chiang.\nA Surprise Find\nDuring the excavation of Tan’s marker in October 2021, a second marker, engraved with just the words “德記界” (Teck Kee’s Boundary in Chinese), was found. This time, some sleuthing was required to unearth its owner and his backstory.\n\nThe Chinese characters 德記界, which mean Teck Kee’s Boundary, were painted in red — an auspicious and eye-catching colour.\nResearchers eventually learnt that the land lot where Tan’s marker had been found, shared a boundary with land owned by Sim Liang Whang (1856-8 March 1921) — a merchant who ran a business called Chop Teck Kee3 at 15 and 16 Kling Street (present-day Chulia Street in downtown Singapore).\nWatch: A Serendipitous Discovery - The Story of Sim Liang Whang's Teck Kee Boundary Marker\n\nSenior Conservator (Objects) Berta Mañas Alcaide shares the steps involved in the conservation of the granite markers while map research consultant Mok Ly Yng discusses the significance of Sim Liang Whang's marker with Winston Lim, General Manager of Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall.\nLand records show that Sim purchased two lots in the area for a combined total of four acres — the size of about two football fields — where he ran a modest rubber plantation. He owned it for 11 years after buying it from another merchant.\nSim, who also traded pepper and gambier4, became synonymous with the name Teck Kee, likely because of the success it saw.\nIn October 2021, both markers were carefully extracted and sent to the Heritage Conservation Centre for cleaning, conservation treatment, and further research.\n\nConservators conducting an initial survey of the boundary markers at the Heritage Conservation Centre.\nDelving deeper into Sim’s story, researchers learnt that Jalan Teck Kee — an existing road on the fringe of Serangoon Gardens which he owned — was named after his business. A village named after the road also sprouted up in the area before it was redeveloped in the 1980s. It was likely that Chop Teck Kee was one of Sim’s most important or significant enterprises.\n\nPrime Minister Lee Kuan Yew greeting residents of Jalan Teck Kee Village from his campaign vehicle during his tour of Serangoon Gardens in 1963.

Collection of the Peranakan Museum.\nBoundary Markers\nIn 1881, Sir Henry Edward McCallum, the Acting Colonial Engineer and Surveyor-General of the Straits Settlements, introduced the practice of marking boundaries permanently with granite stones. On 12 May 1882, the Landmarks Ordinance which required landowners to install appropriate markers, came into effect.\nToday, boundary markers come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Some are cylindrical and made out of concrete, others might be made out of iron spikes. The least obtrusive ones are cut marks on tiles. These days, only land surveyors are permitted to install boundary markers in Singapore.\nTan Kim Seng\nA road, bridge and fountain are named after Tan (8 November 1806-14 March 1864), a prominent Peranakan businessman and philanthropist who is known for his contributions to waterworks in the colony, as well as his charisma and large parties7.\nHis ability to converse in Chinese, Malay and English gave him a leg-up over his business rivals,8 paving the way for him to ink deals with both British and Chinese merchants.9\nOriginally based in Malacca, but prompted to move because the Dutch were taxing businessmen like him heavily, Tan left for British-run Singapore.10\nHe started out trading spices before moving into estate management, making the conscious effort to avoid getting involved in the highly profitable opium trade.\nHis company Hong Hin has roots in Malacca. It was started by his grandfather who moved from China to Malaya in the hopes of carving out a new life. Tan grew Hong Hin and continued to make a success of it.\nWith the goal of raising educational standards, Tan started Chong Wen Ge, Singapore’s first Chinese school in 1849 along Telok Ayer Street. Although the school is now defunct, the pavilion in which it was housed still stands today, having been gazetted as a national monument in 1973 alongside the neighbouring Thian Hock Keng temple. Tan also founded the Chui Eng Free School in 1854.\nSim Liang Whang\nWhile Sim is less famous than Tan, his story is similarly riveting, especially since it offers a snapshot into another strata of society — the upper middle class of yesteryear who poured their hearts into succeeding in the colony.\nSim was a first-generation immigrant to Singapore, having moved to the island as a teenager from the Chao’an District of Guangdong, China.\nTo get an edge over his competitors, he adopted the name Sim Choon Kee which was presumably simpler for English-speaking clients and businessmen to remember. He also went by the name Sim Teck Kee, after his most successful business. This was possibly great for brand recall.\nOver time, Sim became a relatively successful businessman. For instance, his involvement in the rubber trade extended to Johore. According to an advertisement in August 1923, he owned almost 300 acres of rubber estate in Muar and another 85 or so acres in Kota Tinggi.11\nSim also grew to become a prominent Teochew community leader, doing well enough to co-found Tuan Mong School in 1906;12 and contribute to the establishment of one of Singapore’s earliest banks — the Sze Hai Tong Banking & Insurance Company Limited which later merged with the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited or OCBC.13\n\nSim Liang Whang was a Teochew community leader who, among other things, co-founded Tuan Mong School (above) in 1906. Collection of the National Museum of Singapore.\nTo further integrate into the colony, Sim enrolled his sons in English language schools. The oldest, Boon Kwang, became a member of the Singapore Volunteer Infantry and rose to the rank of corporal before leaving the local militia unit in 1907. His second son Boon Eng was a shipping clerk. His youngest, Boon Teck, was a lawyer.\nRecords show that Sim threw his weight behind important political causes. For instance, both he and his son Boon Kwang (沈文光) were members of the Tong Meng Hui (同盟会) Singapore Branch — an underground resistance movement founded by Dr Sun Yat Sen who was involved in overthrowing the Qing dynasty and securing China’s future as a modern republic.\n\nRecord on the Tongmenghui Singapore Branch by Lim Nee Soon (1928) Reproduced with Permission from Xiamen University\nWhile both Tan and Sim’s trajectories differed somewhat, the paths of their descendants would one day converge serendipitously.\nAn entry in the book One Hundred Years’ History of the Chinese in Singapore notes that Boon Kwang and Tan's great-grandson Tan Soo Bin, both members of the Chinese Company of the Singapore Volunteer Infantry, participated in the same meeting in 1905.\n\nTan Kim Seng’s great-grandson Soo Bin and Sim Liang Whang’s son Boon Kwang likely crossed paths while serving as members of the Singapore Volunteer Infantry according to this excerpt from the book One Hundred Years’ History of the Chinese in Singapore (above) which notes that they attended the same meeting in 1905.14\nSim also owned a shop at 71 North Boat Quay called Chop Huat Seng which was likely his final business venture. It was also the site of his wake in 1921. Upon his passing, revolutionary leader Dr Sun conveyed his condolences to Sim’s family through prominent local revolutionary leaders.\nNotes", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/back-on-the-map/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/Back-on-the-Map/Back-on-the-map-banner.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:33"},

By Kelvin Ang Kah Eng\nHead of Heritage Studies Conservation Department\nUrban Redevelopment Authority\nImages: Kelvin Ang Kah Eng\nBeMuse Volume 3 Issue 3 - Jul to Sep 2010\nGrowing up in the early 1970s and in Queenstown, my first impressions of the built environment were very much shaped by the modernist and high-rise public housing that was built by the HDB around me. Home was a 3-room corner at that looked just like many others, and located on the 12th storey of Block 175, Stirling Road. From the common corridor, my friends and I could see the growth of our city as more and more high-rises were built along Orchard Road and the Golden Shoe area.\nThis was just a decade removed, though it could well have been a lifetime, from the environment that my father was familiar with when he was growing up in the 1940s, which was an elevated wooden house in one of the many lorongs off Geylang. They were also a world away from the single storey timber houses in the Upper Thomson ‘Hailam Sua’ area where my mother had friends who lived in rambutan plantations, and where we would go during the holidays to visit and eat rambutans straight off the trees.\nEven closer to my physical home, the image of a local farm house was that of the Malay-style kampong houses, raised on stilts and set amongst coconut groves, that were shown in P. Ramlee movies that I watched with my Malay neighbours – usually with a winsome young lady at the window, singing about her loved one while a gentle breeze rustled her selendang (a kind of shawl).\nIn those simpler days, visiting our neighbours or watching a film was as good as going away on a holiday.\nTwo Traditions of the Kampong House\nSo, back to reality, what were the rural houses that Singapore used to have by the thousands – and which we called the ‘kampong house’?\nGenerically, there were two main traditions of rural domestic houses: namely the Malay-style and the Chinese-style houses.\nView of a Malay Village, Singapore, 1904\nJohn Randall Collection, courtesy of National Archives of Singapore.\nFor the Malay-style house, there are numerous variations in the structural layout of the house and also the roof forms. These variations are tied to the different architectural cultures of the different parts of the Malay Peninsula and archipelago. A good reference book on this topic is The Malay House: Rediscovering Malaysia’s Indigenous Shelter System (1991) by Lim Jee Yuan. However, they all share a few key features that make these homes very much suited to living in the tropics. These features are:\nA steep roof (traditionally of attap thatch – a readily available material, with good heat- insulating properties) that could rapidly throw off rain,\nA verandah in the front, that forms an ‘inside-outside’ living room which is readily cooled by the slightest breeze, while the kitchen is at the rear,\nA timber structural system, with timber walls that often had more windows than walls,\nA raised floor – to keep the inhabitants safe from wandering animals, floods, and also provide better ventilation all round.\nThe Chinese Farm House\nWhat is less fully documented or analysed is the Chinese farm house in this region, which exhibits both commonalities and differences with the indigenous Malay house.\nBeing relatively recent immigrants into the region, Chinese farmers brought their architectural worldview into the region. As practical folks, they too would have made practical adaptations, learning from the locals, to what they would build. However, in certain aspects, they were to be very conservative.\nThe Chinese farm house in this region, and in Singapore, instead of being built from earth, brick and stone as in China, adopted the widespread use of timber for structure and walls. Roofing was also of attap and similar to Malay houses. The house would be under a single roof. Ventilation was provided by a gap of 2 to 3 feet between the top of the wall and the underside of the roof.\nThe house would be rectangular in plan, and based on my memory of houses that I went to as a child, there would be a central living hall where the family ate, and entertained, while bedrooms would be on either side of this hall. Similar though to the Malay house, would be the placement of the kitchen at the rear.\nClose up showing the typical construction of a Chinese farm house.\nPicture is author's own.\nOn elevation, in contrast to the pleasing asymmetry of the Malay house, it retained the traditional approach of a symmetrical façade – with a central main door and flanked by solid plank windows on either side.\nPerhaps the two greatest differences between the two traditions, would be that firstly, Chinese houses were rarely, if ever, raised above the ground. They would sit on the earth, with the upper timber walls resting on a low foundational wall, and unless one was quite wealthy, the floors were of bare compacted earth. Secondly, the verandah that is indispensable to the Malay way of life, is not seen in the Chinese farm house.\nTypical Chinese farm house in the mid 1960s, sitting close to the ground. Pigs, wandering 'garbage conversion units', were an indispensable part of the Chinese rural environment.'\nPost card from author's collection.\nPrivate Havens from the City\nIn relation to the surrounding environment, it can be observed that the Chinese retained the concept of clearly and physically demarcating private land from common land. Their farm houses would have a fence, and sometimes, a gate way, following the practice back in China. For Malay villages, there was demarcation too for individual houses, but often in a less formal way. A common way was the use of spiky plants such as bougainvillea as a ‘fence’. Which by the way, as I learnt in movie and folk tales, had an important role in keeping out unwanted visitors of the spiritual kind – such as the very frightening ‘hantu penanggalan’.\nThese houses, numbering in their thousands across Singapore, were therefore, the homes of those who were in a way fortunate enough to avoid the extreme urban overcrowding that characterised the old city up to the early 1980s. But at the same time, living in a ‘rural idyll’ meant being deprived of basic facilities and amenities of a modern life.\nToday’s Singapore is even more developed, but on Pulau Ubin we still have the opportunity to see some remaining examples of Singaporean Malay and Chinese farmhouses in a traditional rural setting. There, one can find a good representation of these traditional and functional forms of building, albeit, with some recent modifications, such as the replacement of attap roofs with corrugated zinc roofs.\nModernised Chinese farm house near Ubin village, with a zinc roof.\nPicture is author's own.\nVisiting the island gives me a cherished reminder of my childhood visits to Hailam Sua with its farmhouses in the rambutan plantations, as well as brings to life scenes from those early Malay films.\nAbove: House\nBelow: Children in front of a farm house\nWhat is your mental image of a farm house? Is it what we have? Or perhaps, it is more likely to be that of cosy ‘fairytale’ English and European style farm cottages or Tudor-styled thatched buildings where naughty children, elves and fairies were caught up in magical adventures as described by Enid Blyton or the Grimm Brothers?\nWell, I have news for you. Surprisingly, the island also holds one of these ‘fairytale’ farm houses from our old story books. What is this house? That’s a tale I will have to save for another time...\nThe author trained as an architect in University College, London. He still takes the occasional day trip to Ubin, and hopes to be able to stay overnight in one of the farm houses there.", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/the-village-view-recalling-the-local-farm-house/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/the-village-view-recalling-the-local-farm-house/the-village-view-recalling-the-local-farm-house-1.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:34"},

Low and his son had waited at the Singapore waterfront after their mystical dream of a golden light shining from the west. There, they met the monks and nuns, led by Venerable Xian Hui, who were returning to China from a pilgrimage. Low invited them to remain in Singapore to spread the Buddhist faith with Venerable Xian Hui as the monastery’s first abbot. Low donated 12 acres of land and funds for the monastery, while people across the region also contributed financially.\n\nThe monastery has a layout common in Zen Buddhism and is modelled after the Xi Chan Monastery in Fuzhou, China.

Singapore today is known to be a colourful mix of cultures, faiths, and communities. TL;DR\nDid you know that eight out of the eleven public holidays in Singapore are celebrations originating from our various religions and cultures1? Singapore today is known to be a colourful mix of cultures, faiths, and communities. Naturally, our festivals are a rich celebration of our multicultural heritage, as we get to indulge in the sights, sounds, and flavours from our diverse origins.\nA migration of festivities\nTo truly understand how Singapore became such a melting pot of cultures, we have to go back two centuries to when the country was first established as a bustling trading hub of the region.\nSingapore’s special position on the world map naturally put it in the middle of many trade routes. Vessels from all over the world stopped here to resupply or trade. Immigrants from China, India, and the Malay Archipelago, among others, flocked here to seek greater fortunes.\nAfter long, treacherous journeys by sea, many of our forefathers built places of worship along the coast at Telok Ayer Street. Temples, mosques, churches, and shrines were established for the immigrants to give thanks to their gods2 for providing them safe passage, and to ask for blessings in the new chapter of their lives. Telok Ayer Street is today the street with the most number of national monuments in Singapore. With the freedom to practise their faiths freely, our immigrants also brought with them the festivals celebrated by the Muslims, Hindus, and the Chinese – festivals that have grown to become the vibrant spectacles of modern Singapore.\nLet’s begin our festival journey with the first celebration of the year.\nPongal\nUsually in: January, place of origin: India\nA beautiful festival of offering thanks to nature, Pongal is traditionally a harvest festival originating from South India celebrated in the beginning of Thai, the tenth Tamil month. Cooked rice is traditionally offered to the deities to thank them for a bountiful harvest3.\nThe Pongal bazaar at Campbell Lane4 is where local Indians can find their favourite goodies and buy offerings such as the Indian sugar cane, ginger and turmeric plants, and devotional milk pots5.\nThe Pongal bazaar is a feast of the senses and perfect for immersing yourself in the festival atmosphere. (c. 2015. Image from ghettosingapore.com)\nLunar New Year\nUsually in: January or February, place of origin: China6\nSqueezing through the crowds at the Chinatown night market7 in the month leading up to Lunar New Year is perhaps an experience every Singaporean Chinese gladly shares. Entire streets decorated in splashes of red and gold, massive light displays8, long queues outside popular bakwa (barbecued pork) stalls9, and street vendors loudly touting traditional goodies and introducing the latest flavours.10\nLunar New Year is the most anticipated festival among the local Chinese community. Celebrated on the first day of the Chinese Lunar Calendar, the entire fiesta lasts 15 days. On New Year’s Eve, every Chinese, no matter which corner of the world they might be in, would return home to their family for a reunion dinner.11 After the meal, many families would gather around the TV to watch the countdown performance broadcasted from Chinatown.12\nThe following morning, everyone puts on new clothes to welcome new beginnings, and visit their relatives to exchange blessings13, never once taking a break from the mouth-watering pineapple tarts, and other festival snacks. This goes on for two weeks, punctuated by steamboat dinners, yusheng ceremony (raw fish salad tossing)14, and even more gatherings with friends and relatives.15\nThe Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple is packed with devotees every Chinese New Year’s Eve offering their prayers. Many believe that the first person to offer their incense will receive bountiful blessings during that year. (c. 2015. Image from ghettosingapore.com)\nThe River Hong Bao is a week-long extravaganza16 held every Chinese New Year along the Singapore River since 198717. This five-storey high Monkey God18 was the main attraction for the celebration of the Year of the Monkey. (c. 1992. Image from National Museum of Singapore)\nSince 197319, the Chingay Parade is an annual street festival participated by members of every ethnic community. The procession is a multi-sensory spectacle of floats representing different grassroots associations and communities. (c. 1970s–80s. Image from National Museum of Singapore)\nThaipusam\nUsually in: January or February20, place of origin: India, religious roots: Hinduism\nFor Hindus, one of the most powerful ways of showing devotion to their deities takes place at the annual Thaipusam Festival. On the full-moon day in the month of Thai in the Tamil calendar, Hindus in Singapore commemorate the victory of Lord Subramaniam (also known as Lord Murugan) over the evil forces with a vel (spear), an element which has become the most recognisable part of the festival21. \nThe most pious believers pierce their bodies and faces with hundreds of needles from their kavadi22, a structure of at least 20 kg23 in weight that they carry, and walk barefoot for 3 to 4 km24 as an offering to the deity. This arduous walk of faith stretches from Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple to Sri Thendayuthapani Temple. Devotees are usually cheered on by close friends and families, who walk together with them while carrying palkudam (devotional milk pots)25.\nThousands of bystanders offer additional encouragement along the route, starting on Serangoon Road and finishing Tank Road, eager to be part of the devotees’ journey of devotion.\nOnly the most pious devotees carry the kavadi for this 4-km walk. Here is a shot from the procession along Selegie Road. (c. 2015. Image from ghettosingapore.com)\nThe kavadi is carried primarily with a belt and pierced to the body using hooks, needles and spikes. (c. 1970–1980s. Image from National Museum of Singapore)\nKavadis are traditionally made of wood or steel, and adorned with peacock feathers, milk pots, flowers, and pictures of deities. (c. 20th century. Image from Asian Civilisations Museum)\nVesak Day\nUsually in: May, place of origin: Nepal / Sri Lanka, religious roots: Buddhism\nBuddhists from around the world honour Vesak Day as a commemoration to Buddha’s birth and enlightenment. Celebrated on the full-moon day of May27, Buddhists come together to remind their communities of Buddha’s teachings and to renew their resolutions of leading a life of morality, humility, and simplicity.28\nAround Singapore, Buddhists visit temples and offer flowers, joss sticks, and prayers,29 while the more devout perform a “Three Steps, One Bow” ritual to express repentance.30 Monks also give talks about peace and happiness at temples, and how the 25-century-old teachings apply to the islander’s fast-paced urban life.31\nKong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery is well known for the “Three Steps, One Bow” ritual performed by its devotees on the eve of Vesak Day every year.\nHari Raya Puasa\nPlace of origin: Middle East, religious roots: Islam\nHari Raya Puasa, also known as Hari Raya Aidilfitri, is the celebration of the end of Ramadan, the islamic month of fasting and prayer. On the first day of Syawal, or the tenth month of the Islamic calendar, the Muslim community gathers to bond, feast, and to celebrate. As families come together32, the younger generation would take turns to kiss the hand of their elders as a sign of respect, while asking them for forgiveness.33 A beautiful practice common in Southeast Asia, families would put on the same colours when they go out visiting to show their unity.34\nThe Hari Raya Light-up at Geylang Serai is one of the biggest highlights of the festival, with miles of brightly lit stalls selling a wide variety of Malay culinary delights, gifts, and clothes at the Ramadan bazaar.\nDuring Hari Raya Puasa, we get to indulge in the famous beef rendang (spicy beef stew), ketupat (rice cakes wrapped in coconut leaves), and lontong (rice cakes with coconut gravy). And of course, the celebration isn’t complete without the delicious kueh (sweets) and biscuits, which are must-haves for every family.35\nThe Ramadan Bazaar at Geylang Serai. (c. 2015.

The successful actress starred in many films including Aloha (1950), Aladdin (1952), and Abu Hasan Penchuri (1955). (c. 1960s. Image from National Museum of Singapore)\nHari Raya Haji\nPlace of origin: Middle East, religious roots: Islam\nA sacred festival of sacrifice and sharing, Hari Raya Haji marks the end of Haj37, or the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. Muslims across Singapore gather in mosques for prayers while the Korban ritual is performed. Lambs and sheep are sacrificed and the meat will be distributed to the poor and needy. This symbolic ritual honours Prophet Ibrahim’s devotion in offering his own flesh and blood as a sacrifice to Allah.38\nAn occasion of sharing and giving, devotees help to distribute meat to the needy on Hari Raya Haji at Sultan Mosque. (c. 2013. Image from ghettosingapore.com)\nMid-Autumn Festival\nUsually in: September or October39, place of origin: China\nAlso called the Lantern Festival among the local Chinese community40, Mid-Autumn Festival is celebrated on the full moon (fifteenth day) of the eighth month of the Chinese lunar calendar.41 Giant lantern displays are put up in Chinatown throughout the month to mark this special occasion.42 On this evening, children parade the streets with their own lanterns while adults come together to eat mooncakes and appreciate what they believe to be the roundest and brightest moon of the year.43\nEvery year, local bakeries and restaurants use this occasion to come up with creative twists to the traditional mooncake, infusing popular flavours such as durian, strawberry, and even truffles.44\nChinatown is also home to the annual Mid-Autumn Light-Up Ceremony. This is a shot from the finale performance in 2015. (c. 2015. Image from ghettosingapore.com)\nThe mooncake, a traditional Chinese pastry eaten during Mid-Autumn Festival, usually comes in exquisite boxes such as this. This packaging came from Nam Thong Restaurant and features an illustration of “Emperor Tang Ming visiting the Moon Palace”. (c. mid-20th century. Image from National Museum of Singapore)\nThis mooncake mould is made of hardwood. The four motifs seen her are the Chinese characters for 花好月圆, signifying a beautiful time of flowers blossoming under the full moon. (c. 1970s. Image from National Museum of Singapore)\nDeepavali\nUsually in: October or November, place of origin: India, religious roots: Hindusim\nThe Festival of Lights is one of the most important festivals for Hindus.45 This day is a celebration of the victory of Lord Krishna over King Narakasura, the triumph of good over evil, and light conquering darkness.46\nLittle India bursts into life with hundreds of metres of decorative lighting, bazaars, and celebratory activities, as devotees flock to the temples to offer their prayers.47 Follow the scent of floral garlands and incense as you browse through the colourful stalls filled with traditional snacks, embroidered sari (traditional Indian womenswear), and thousands of bangles.48\nThe Sri Mariamman Temple, the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore49, also hosts a fiery spectacle a week leading up to Deepavali. Here, you can join thousands of devotees as they walk on burning charcoal as a tribute to the goddess Sri Drowpathai Amman.50\nDeepavali in Singapore’s Little India has always been a brightly lit and colourful event. (c1980s. Image from National Museum of Singapore)\nChristmas\nFalls on: 25 December, place of origin: Rome, religious roots: Christianity\nIn December every year, malls along Orchard Road showcase their themed decorations and Christmas trees, turning the entire shopping street into a parade of lights.51 Our tropical Christmas is celebrated by most as an occasion to indulge in our favourite hobbies – eating and shopping. Christmas menus pop up in every restaurant and our retail outlets lure in shoppers with Christmas sales and promotions.52\nFor the Christians in Singapore, the season of sharing brings the community together in churches for prayers and midnight masses. Traditional Christmas meals take on a creative local twist, infused with our favourite spices such as ginger, chilli, and even curry.\nWhen night falls, that’s when the real show on Orchard Road begins. Over the years, the Christmas decorations have gotten increasingly creative and magnificent. (c. mid 1980s.

Chinese green-splashed wares were widely imitated in the Middle East, but artists there created their own distinct variations, often adding inscriptions.

Waters rising from deep sources do not end in drought; forming a river, they flow on to the sea.\n- Yongbi eochonga (Songs of the Dragons Flying to Heaven)1\nLike a tree with deep roots, the Joseon dynasty which spanned more than 500 years is one of the longest-ruling dynasties in the world. Founded in 1392 by the military general Yi Seonggye (1335 to 1408), the new dynastic name Joseon was based on that of Korea’s first kingdom, called Gojoseon. Apart from referencing Korea’s legendary past, the name also signalled Yi’s desire for new beginnings, for Joseon means “Fresh Dawn” or “New Dynasty”.\nGeneral Yi, also known as King Taejo (reigned from 1392 to 1398), broke with the past by moving the capital from Gaegyeong (present-day Gaesong, North Korea) to a new site – Hanyang (present-day Seoul). More importantly, he supplanted Buddhism with Neo-Confucianism as the kingdom’s state ideology. King Taejo as well as his successors sought to curtail the power and excesses of the Buddhist establishment, which had become saddled with corruption.\nThis elevated status of Neo-Confucianism distinguished the Joseon period from preceding dynasties by greatly shaping political and socio-cultural life, as well as much of the arts produced during the era. For instance, the Confucian emphasis on modesty can be discerned from Joseon porcelain which were often simple yet elegantly designed (fig. 1).\n(Fig. 1) Moon jar, 18th century. Porcelain, height 46 cm.\nCollection of National Museum of Korea.\nThis Joseon adoption of Neo-Confucianism underscores the powerful influence which China traditionally had on Korea. The geographical location of Korea, lying between China and Japan, fostered much cultural and economic interaction as well as conflicts among these three countries. The devastation wrought on the Joseon kingdom by the Japanese invasions in the late 16th century as well as by the Manchu invasions in the early 17th century was a turning point in Korean history.\nDespite these upheavals, Joseon Korea experienced many artistic and scientific advances, especially under the leadership of several strong Joseon kings. Most of these important developments occurred during the 15th and 18th centuries, which are regarded as the two golden ages of the Joseon period. The fourth monarch, King Sejong (reigned from 1418 to 1450), is often regarded as the most outstanding among the Joseon kings. In addition to his social reforms, he sponsored many scientific and cultural projects. He is especially renowned for implementing a new phonetic alphabet in 1446. Initially called Hunmin Jeongeum (Korean for “correct sounds to instruct the people”) and better known today as Hangeul, the alphabet project stemmed from King Sejong’s desire to provide his people with a written means of expression that could be learned and used with greater ease, instead of the complicated Chinese system.\nThe King And His Court\nAs the head of a Confucian state, a Joseon king was expected to possess excellent moral fibre, wisdom and erudition. From a young age, Joseon princes were subjected to a rigorous education in the Confucian classics and history in a bid to become sage-kings. This was especially important as a king’s moral stature was thought to affect the stability and success of his rule. This belief was undergirded by the Confucian concept of the Mandate of Heaven, which General Yi invoked to establish the legitimacy of the new Joseon dynasty and his right to rule.\nThe Confucian emphasis on ritual propriety saw many ceremonies being conducted at the Joseon court. These were collectively referred to as the Five Rites of State and formally instituted in 1474. The Five Rites consisted of auspicious rites (gillye) which included memorial services to past Joseon kings and queens, celebratory rites (garye) which were performed on joyous occasions such as weddings, reception rites (billye) to welcome foreign dignitaries, military rites (gullye), and last but not least, inauspicious rites (hyungnye) that pertained to mourning and funerals. These events allowed the monarchy to project its authority over officials, foreign envoys and the masses, while promoting harmony among the people.\nIn addition to participating in many of these rites as a representative of the Joseon people, the kings also wielded objects to signify their status and supremacy. Many of these objects such as the Sun, Moon and Five Peaks screens, royal seals, and items of clothing have become key icons of the Joseon period. The vividly-coloured screens depicting the Sun, Moon and Five Peaks (fig. 2) were seen to embody the universe and its cosmic forces. Set behind the royal throne or a king’s royal portrait, these screens were associated with kingly power and signified the monarch’s presence even when he was physically absent.\n(Fig. 2) Sun, Moon and Five Peaks, 19th century or early 20th century. Six-fold screen, colours on silk, 149.3 x 351.8 cm.\nCollection of National Palace Museum of Korea, Seoul.\nSuch screen paintings were among the many fine objects sponsored by the king and his court. While some of the iconography were originally restricted for royal use only, certain motifs such as those with auspicious meanings became popular and were used by other members of society during the late Joseon period. For instance, folding screens which depicted books arranged on shelves called chaekgado (fig. 3) are believed to have first appeared at the Joseon court in the late 18th century at the behest of King Jeongjo (reigned from 1776 to 1800), who was known for his great love of books and scholarship. Such screens featuring books, which were sometimes portrayed with scholarly paraphernalia and other valued possessions, were subsequently embraced by scholar-officials as well as the middle classes. The types and designs of other courtly objects such as porcelains and dress ornaments also shaped tastes and trends beyond the palace walls.\n(Fig. 3) Shelves Full of Books, 19th or early 20th century. 10-fold screen, colours on silk, 161.7 x 395 cm.\nCollection of National Palace Museum of Korea, Seoul.\nThe Yangban and Aristocratic Life\nAnother key group that contributed much to the artistic legacy of the Joseon dynasty were the yangban. They formed the highest social class and constituted the kingdom’s intellectual and cultural leaders. The yangban comprised the two orders of civil and military officials serving in the government, as well as their families. The yangban also referred to members of select lineage groups with distinguished ancestors such as prominent scholar-officials. In fact, from the mid-17th century onwards, many yangban no longer worked for the government but resided in the countryside away from the main administrative centres.\nWhether they were rich or poor, part of the government bureaucracy or not, the yangban were regarded as the moral pillar of Joseon society. As such, they were expected to devote themselves to the Confucian doctrine of self-cultivation and study. In addition to their pursuit of scholarship, the yangban also devoted much of their energies to calligraphy, painting, music and literature. Many yangban were highly accomplished in the arts of the brush, such as Kang Huian (1417 to 1464) and Kim Jeonghui (1786 to 1856), who were known for their adroitness in painting and calligraphy respectively (figs. 4 and 5).\n(Fig. 4) Kim Jeonghui, Calligraphy of Kim Yugeun's Autobiography of Mukso, 1837-1840.

Album leaf, ink on paper, 23.4 x 15.7 cm.\nCollection of National Museum of Korea, Seoul.\nThe adherence to Confucian ideals and its hierarchical values was also translated into the living spaces of the yangban. The emphasis on the dichotomy between genders shaped the spatial arrangement of yangban households, while influencing the type and style of furnishings used in the respective spaces. For instance, the living quarters of both genders were separated, with the men’s quarters (sarangchae) located in the eastern section of the residence, and the women’s quarters (anchae) to the west. This corresponded with the traditional notion that the east symbolised yang or masculine energy, while the west represented yin or feminine energy.\nMoreover, furniture used in the sarangchae and more specifically, the sarangbang (master’s room which also served as a study, bedroom and reception hall) were often designed with a minimalist aesthetic (fig. 6). Clean lines and a lack of ornamentation characterised the wooden furniture used in the men’s quarters.\n(Fig. 6) Document chest, 19th century. Wood, 36.2 x 144 x 22.5 cm.\nCollection of National Museum of Korea, Seoul.\nOn the other hand, the furniture and implements used by the women in the inner quarters were more colourful and elaborately designed (fig. 7).\n(Fig. 7) Comb box, 19th century. Lacquered wood with mother-of-pearl inlay, 30 x 29.5 x 29.5 cm.\nCollection of National Museum of Korea, Seoul.\nEveryday Life Of The Joseon People\nWhile the Joseon landscape was shaped largely by the tastes and patronage of the royal and aristocratic elite, it was also enriched by the vibrant arts cultural and crafts produced for the wider populace.\nBy the early 16th century, the Joseon kingdom’s population had exceeded ten million, nearly doubling the size it had been at the start of the dynastic period. The growth was spurred by improvements in agricultural technology which increased productivity. The capital Hanyang was not only the centre of political life but a major commercial city drawing people from all walks of life and from around the country. The Joseon population was divided into four classes. After the yangban, who enjoyed the highest social status, came the jungin. This referred to people who possessed technical skills or professional knowledge, such as doctors, astronomers and interpreters. Below them were the sangmin or commoners – farmers, artisans, and merchants, who formed the largest segment of the population. At the lowest social stratum were the low-born (cheonin), which included butchers, musicians and courtesans.\nThe daily lives of all classes became the subject of genre paintings, a major form of Korean art that flourished in the 18th century (fig. 8). The paintings focused on candid depictions of commoners at work and at leisure. The trend was spurred by the growing interest among intellectuals in Korea’s native customs and crafts, as well as its agriculture and geography. This developed under the banner of Silhak (Korean for “Practical Learning”) – a popular movement during the late 17th and 18th century which advocated a practical approach to statecraft.\nJo Yeongseok (1686-1761).

Bequest of Lee Hong-kun.\nJoseon Legacies\nWhile Joseon regarded China as the bastion of civilisation in East Asia, and much of its art and culture took reference from its continental neighbour, the kingdom also adapted other foreign influences, and developed its own distinct style and identity. For example, not only were traditional Chinese painting themes reinterpreted by Joseon artists, the 18th century also saw the flourishing of true-view landscape painting that emphasised actual native scenery. Prior to this new movement, Joseon painters tended to portray idealised landscapes drawn from Chinese cultural references or generic images of nature.\nDespite the political and economic strife of the 19th century, many of the socio-cultural changes introduced by the Joseon dynasty have enjoyed an enduring legacy. Much of what is considered traditional, as well as the social customs and beliefs that are a prominent part of life in South Korea today, emerged during the Joseon era. Examples include the emphasis on filial piety, as well as respect for seniority and age – both of which characterise social relations in contemporary South Korea. Much of Korea’s rich cultural heritage, including its cuisine, architecture, performing, visual and literary arts, and even alphabet – were created during the Joseon dynasty.\n1 Written in the mid-15th century, Yongbi eocheonga is the first literary work written in Hangeul. The text praises the virtues and heroic deeds of the first and third king of the Joseon dynasty as well as their ancestors.

Every ingredient has a symbolic, auspicious phrase to be exclaimed as it is added to the salad, and diners often toss the salad as high as possible into the air to welcome greater abundance and prosperity.\nIntroduction\nLohei, or 捞起 in Cantonese, is one of the biggest highlights during Chinese New Year, where families and friends come together to “toss up a good fortune”. The yusheng, 鱼生, is a mixture of thinly sliced raw fish and shredded vegetables, seasonings, and condiments - added one by one in a specific order. Each ingredient symbolises well-wishing. With each added ingredient, an auspicious phrase is recited.\nDiners would then stand around the table, each with a pair of chopsticks to toss the mix while exchanging blessings. It is popularly believed that the higher the toss, the better one’s prospects and fortune for the year ahead.\nA vibrant centrepiece dish comprising various ingredients, each with its own flavour and meaning behind it. The yusheng is usually the first order of business at any family or corporate gathering during Chinese New Year.)\nA humble 2,000-year-old tradition\nThe earliest written documentation of eating raw fish in Chinese culture traces back to 823 BCE during the Zhou Dynasty (1046 BCE–256 BCE). During the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), it became so popular that Chinese scholars such as Cao Zhi wrote poems praising the delicacy. However, towards the end of the Qing dynasty (1889 CE–1912 CE) the dish almost disappeared in China and was only common in the southern parts of Guangzhou and Chaozhou.\nIn the Guangzhou cities of Jiangmen and Shunde, fishermen would celebrate the 7th day of Lunar New Year, or 人日, believed to be the birthday of all of humanity. On this day, the fishermen would feast on their catches – a humble, raw common carp dish mixed with soy sauce, vinegar, peanut oil, pickled shallots, and shredded vegetables.\nYu Sheng, a name of abundance\nThese early fishermen called the dish yusheng, which plays beautifully on the homophones of both “鱼” (fish) and “余” (abundance), as well as “生”, which means both ‘raw’ and ‘life’. So, yusheng also means “abundance of wealth and long life”.\nYusheng was introduced by Cantonese and Teochew immigrants from China. Since the 1930s, what started out as a simple raw fish dish has gone through multiple evolutions to become the dish it is known as today.\nThe commonly used fish in yusheng are either salmon or wolf herring. But in recent years, abalone and tuna have become the new adaptations depending on family culture and preferences.\nThe forefathers of yusheng in Singapore – Four Heavenly Kings\nEarly immigrants to Singapore had adapted the dish, such as replacing grass carp with wolf herring to avoid parasites from carp. Yusheng in the 1900s consisted of raw fish, slices of cucumber, radish, and coriander topped with vinegar, oil and sugar. As the dish evolved according to local tastes and ingredients, Loong Yik Kee Restaurant started selling its unique version in 1933, with the addition of pickled vegetables, sugar and vinegar.\nAs the trend caught on, chefs in Singapore started experimenting with their own versions. In 1964, four chefs at the newly opened Lai Wah Restaurant (known affectionately as the “Four Heavenly Kings”) Loke Yuke Pui, Than Mui Kai Yu, Hooi Kok Wai, and Sin Leung, came up with the “七彩鱼生” (seven-coloured raw fish salad). Their version was introduced with improved fragrance, more colours, and served with greater texture and depth with the addition of peanut and flour crisps.\nMaster chef Hooi Kok Wai, co-founder of Dragon Phoenix restaurant, still spends the majority of his day at wet markets in search of good and fresh fish.\n“We also gave our yusheng different names. Since everyone likes prosperity, we called it ‘好运鱼生’ (good luck yusheng), ‘发财鱼生’ (prosperity yusheng) and ‘鸿运鱼生’ (fortune yusheng).”\n- Chef Hooi Kok Wai\nLohei - Created by the people, loved across generations\nYusheng became widely popular in Singapore after the Four Heavenly Kings decided to add their seven-coloured yusheng to their Chinese New Year set dinners. The trend picked up in the 1970s, when the younger diners started embracing it.\nWhen the dish was first introduced, the four chefs paired auspicious phrases with some of the original ingredients. Red pickled ginger was paired with “鸿运当头”, or “Good luck is approaching”. Persimmon came with “四季平安”, translating to “Four seasons of peace and prosperity”. For five spice powder or pepper, they would say “五福临门”, “5 blessings – longevity, wealth, health, kindness and peace upon your home”.\nThe customers themselves spontaneously associated other ingredients with their own auspicious phrases and well wishes.\nSome references also speculated that because the dish was so big and difficult to mix evenly, diners started to stand up from their seats to help the waiter toss the yusheng. This somehow evolved to become a ritual where everyone stands up as a celebration of togetherness.\nAs the popularity of yusheng soared throughout Singapore and Malaysia, it gradually became the must-have dish of today. Every family dinner or corporate gathering during Chinese New Year would have to involve lohei. This practice is celebrated at restaurants, homes, and office pantries, and came to include friends and colleagues from different cultures – wherever people fancied a lively gathering around the table.\nA step-by-step guide to Lohei\n\nSteps\nPhrases\n1.\nThe yusheng is placed on the table, as diners gather around.\nGong xi fa cai 恭喜发财: ‘Congratulations for your great wealth!’\nWan shi ru yi 万事如意: ‘May all your wishes be fulfilled!’\n2.\nRaw fish slices are added.\nNian nian you yu 年年有余: ‘May you have abundance every year!’ ‘Fish’ (yu) and ‘abundance’ (yu) in Mandarin are homophones.\n3. \nPomelo or lime is added.\nDa ji da li 大吉大利: ‘May you have great luck and prosperity!’\n4.\nSpices are added.\nZhao cai jin bao 招财进宝: ‘May you attract wealth and treasures!’\n5.\nOil and plum sauce are drizzled over the ingredients.\nYi ben wan li 一本万利: ‘May your capital bring you ten-thousand-fold profits!’\nCai yuan guang jin 财源广进: ‘May your sources of wealth bring you great prosperity!’\n6.\nShredded carrot is added.\nHong yun dang tou 鸿运当头: ‘Good luck is approaching!’ ‘Red’ (hong, referring to the reddish hue of carrots) and ‘great’ (hong) are homophones.\n7.\nShredded green radish is added.\nQing chun yong zhu 青春永驻: ‘May you remain forever youthful!’ ‘Green’ (qing) and qing in qing chun (‘youthful’) are homophones.\n8.\nShredded white radish is added.\nFeng sheng shui qi 风生水起: ‘May you progress quickly!’\nBu bu gao sheng 步步高升: ‘May you rise to greater heights!’\n9.\nCrushed peanuts are poured over the ingredients.\nJin yin man wu 金银满屋: ‘May your house be filled with gold and silver!’\n10.\nSesame seeds are sprinkled.\nSheng yi xing long 生意兴隆: ‘May your business prosper!’\n11.\nDeep-fried flour crisps in the shape of golden pillows are added.\nMan di huang jin 满地黄金: ‘May your floor be covered in gold!’\n12.\nThe diners stand and proceed to toss the ingredients on the plate.\nLo hei 捞起: ‘Let’s toss up good fortune!’\n  Lohei – the evolution of a tradition that constantly brings people together\nToday, friends and families celebrate lohei in restaurants and homes, welcoming the new year with words of prosperity and a strong sense of togetherness. Every ingredient represents a blessing, and every lohei signifies a strong sense of unity and good intentions for the new year.\nAs times evolve, the yusheng dish continues to incorporate new adaptations to suit different preferences, welcoming diners from other cultures to join in the celebrations.\n“For instance, some add abalone, salmon and even lobster. The ingredients then become more flavourful. To customers, more choices is always a good thing. If yusheng can be brought to greater heights and out of this region, that will be the best. However, I feel that fish should still be at the heart of yusheng.”\n- Chef Hooi Kok Wai\nSingapore restaurants in recent years have also started offering halal yusheng1, takeaway yusheng, vegetarian and vegan yusheng (fish is replaced by gluten strips of vegetable), and even a yusheng buffet2. Those looking for a convenient option can even pick up a ready-made yusheng from the supermarket to bring home for the toss.\nThis year, Singaporeans will also get to experience a different kind of lohei to help us stay safe during the global Covid-19 pandemic. Diners at restaurants will have to refrain from shouting their auspicious phrases while donning a face mask. But despite these limitations, lohei remains part of many Singaporeans’ Chinese New Year celebrations this year, and perhaps as Chef Hooi suggested, “Silence is golden, and perhaps this might even add more prosperity to our lohei.”\nNotes", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/Lohei", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Louhei-2021/NHB_ICH_LoHei_Website_Banner_20210204.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:35"},

This preserved ingredient - with a pungent smell - has found itself at odds with contemporary palates over the last century in Singapore.\nBy Wong Pui Lam Lydia (NTU History Programme)\n  Chinese salted fish sold at Sheng Shiong supermarket, 2021 (Photo credit: Lydia Wong)\nSalted fish is, as its name implies, fish that has been salted. This simple process utilises a single ingredient – salt to preserve fish as it extracts water out of the fish and also prevents the growth of microbes. Salted fish is consumed in different traditional cuisines around the world, especially in places close to the seas and oceans. In Chinese cuisine (both that of maritime Southeast Asia and China), the use of salted fish is most associated with Cantonese cuisine due to the large number of dishes that use the ingredient. It is traditionally consumed not only because of its long shelf life but also, more importantly, for the distinctive flavours that it brings. Just like soy sauce (liquid condiment made from fermented soy beans), bean sauce (fermented bean paste made from soy beans), fish sauce (liquid condiment made from fermented fish) and salted vegetables (fermented and brined vegetables), the ingredient makes a dish savoury and imparts a unique, deeper taste not found in plain salt or in any of the above mentioned ingredients.\nMuiheung salted fish made with mackerel which goes by ma kao yu (马鲛鱼), stored in a glass jar filled with oil sold at dried seafood retailer, 2021 (Source: Lydia Wong)\nIkan kurau (Indian threadfin which goes by ma you yu, 马油鱼) salted fish made in Penang, Malaysia sold at a local dried seafood retailer, 2021 (Source: Lydia Wong)\nThe salted fish used in Cantonese cuisines is not necessarily restricted to a particular species or type of fish. Fishermen, whether deep-sea fishers or those operating in the intertidal zones closer to shore, had traditionally salted the fishes they caught to preserve them, minimising losses from spoilage. Besides the variety of fish species, there are also varieties to the method of drying and the resultant product. In most cuisines around the world, the salted fish commonly used is that with a hard flesh (a result of the drying process the fish undergoes). For the salted fish used in Cantonese cuisine, it is separated into two types: sat yoke (實肉) and muiheung (霉香/梅香). Sat yoke means hard flesh and is similar to most salted fish found in other traditional cuisines. For the muiheung (霉香) variety, mui (霉) means mold and heung (香) stands for fragrance, which provide clues to how the muiheung salted fish is prepared and the reasons for its popularity. While any fish can be made into the muiheung salted fish, the Spanish mackerel (ma kao yu, 马交鱼) and threadfin (ma you yu, 马油鱼) are preferred due to its high fat content, fleshy meat and bigger bones which allows for easier deboning. To prepare a muiheung salted fish, one has to ferment the fish – the process known in Cantonese as faat mui (发霉) or faat gau (发酵) – for a number of days before commencing salting and drying. The additional fermentation of the fish results in a crumbly paste-like texture and a unique scent. Those accustomed to the smell describe it as “fragrant”, while others can be put off by it.\nSection on the state of the market for Chinese salted fish in Nanyang Siang Pau, 1931 (Source: National Library Board)\nDifferent Chinese salted fish produced, sold and exported by A Tjap‘s (Chinese name: 朱沛然) store Toko Burni Baru in Indonesia, 2021 (Source: Zhu Pei Ran)\nSingapore has long been an important regional entrepôt and centre for the salted fish trade. Its supply of salted fish came from different places like Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Hong Kong and parts of South China. The Nanyang Siang Pau in pre-war Singapore reports on salted fish supplies and prices regularly, in full page spreads, alongside essential food items like eggs, oil and rice, and precious metals like gold. The price of Chinese salted fish was reported to be sold at a cheaper price in Singapore than in some places of production like Malaysia. Today, most of the salted fish sold in Singapore’s dried good stores or supermarkets are from Malaysia and Indonesia.\nHeadline of an article “Sanitary Board forces salted fish traders at Lau Pa Sat to shut down their businesses due to sanitary threats to public servants caused by foul smell. Sellers are given 7 days to remove salted fish” published in Nanyang Siang Pau on 7 March 1934 (Source: Nanyang Siang Pau © Singapore Press Holdings Limited)\nOver the last century, the consumption of salted fish has often been discouraged and viewed negatively. In colonial Singapore, the Sanitary Board banned the sale of Chinese salted fish at Lau Pa Sat on one notable occasion in 1934. The foul smell was perceived to be a threat to the area’s hygiene and also to the health of government officials working there. The issue was eventually resolved through intervention of the General Chinese Trade Affairs Association (present-day Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce & Industry) with the complete removal of the item from the affected dried seafood retailers. This episode, however, did little to reduce the viability and consumption of salted fish among the Chinese in pre-war Singapore.\nUp till the 1970s, salted fish continued to be a common food item as it was cheap and alongside with salty ingredients like preserved vegetables, its salty taste was thought to help people consume more rice which filled their stomachs more. In emerging discussions around nutritional health in the Nanyang Siang Pau in the late 1960s, salted fish along with preserved sausages were described as vital sources of protein in an otherwise carbohydrate heavy diet. However, reports in the 70s began surfacing on the possible link between nasopharyngeal cancer and salted fish which then gradually affected the demand for the commodity. By the 1990s, salted fish had come to be perceived as being synonymous with cancer and its consumption discouraged. With reduced sodium intake for health reasons and increased disposable incomes increasing the affordability of fresh fish, the consumption of salted fish has declined continually over the years. One wonders what the future holds for this historically important food item. Will there be a revival in its culinary use or consumption? Or would it become a relic of the culinary and food history?\nSpecial feature: Song Garden, Mercure Hotel Bugis\nClaypot rice with chicken, preserved sausage, salted fish and choy sum served at Song Garden at Mercure Hotel, 2021 (Source: Lydia Wong)\nFried rice with chicken and salted fish served at Song Garden at Mercure Hotel, 2021 (Source: Lydia Wong)\nStewed silken tofu with minced pork and salted fish served at Song Garden at Mercure Hotel, 2021 (Source: Lydia Wong)\nSmall bites of pastries (xiang yu ji li wei, 咸鱼鸡粒味) and baos (xian yu sheng jian bao, 咸鱼生煎包) with fillings utilising salted fish prepared by Chef Huang Shea Neung from Song Garden at Mercure Hotel, 2021 (Source: Lydia Wong)\nEvery now and then, I will crave for the delectable and fragrant scent of the salted fish. Chef Huang Shea Neung who serves Cantonese cuisine at Song Garden, Mercure Hotel, kindly prepared a feast that featured salted fish in every dish served. Chefs in zau laus (酒楼) – high-end Chinese restaurants, pride themselves in being able to cook special dishes requested by the customers, as long as the ingredients are available. The dishes served were claypot rice with preserved sausage, chicken and salted fish, fried rice with salted fish, stewed tofu with minced meat and salted fish, mini char siew buns with salted fish and lastly, mini chicken pies with salted fish. The first three dishes were not on the menu and the latter two mini-bite pastries were unique creations that Chef Huang prepared for this occasion. Ingredients like salted fish and dishes cooked with claypots would not have been served in zau laus as they were considered unpresentable in these places associated with fine dining. Salted fish dishes that we see in zau laus today are due to more people (with higher disposable incomes as the economy improved) dining there and requesting for dishes commonly cooked and consumed at home. It is this new demand that perhaps provides the greatest hope for the survival and future of this delicacy.\nCredits\nSpecial thanks to Eng Kiat for his enormous wealth of knowledge on food and for connecting me to the incredible Cantonese chefs like Chef Huang Shea Neung at Song Garden, Mercure Hotel who kindly cooked a storm of dishes starring Chinese salted fish, Chef Cui who kindly shared on how the use of Chinese salted fish in Cantonese cuisine in Singapore evolved over the decades and salted fish producer A Tjap, all whom without this photo essay could not have realised.

{"id": "EC1CB8DB-0C57-4BBD-99BD-BD8C887E854B", "title": "Heritage Volunteer: Lien Wen Sze", "dated": "unknown", "artist": "unknown", "role": "unknown", "department": "unknown", "medium": "unknown", "country": "china", "description": "Whenever Lien Wen Sze goes to the Asian Civilisations Museum, she is armed with a mind full of knowledge, and often, with her friends and family in tow. Whenever Dr Lien Wen Sze goes to the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM), she is armed with a mind full of knowledge, and her friends and family in tow. The volunteer Mandarin Guide is on a mission to get more people to visit Singapore’s museums, beginning from the one she has been conducting tours in for the last two years.\n“I find this museum so wonderful,” says the 69-year-old retiree about the ACM. “I come here once a week with different groups of friends. I take them around, and invite them for tea, of course!”\nWen Sze’s love affair with ACM began after retiring as a food scientist at multinational food-and-beverage corporation Nestle. Not contented with just reading for pleasure, the bibliophile signed up to be a museum docent after chancing upon an open call for volunteers.\n“Being a Singaporean, I feel the need to be more aware of our surrounding countries,” she says. “Coming to the Asian Civilisations Museum gives me opportunities to learn with a focus, and a chance to share my knowledge.”\nWen Sze was familiar with Chinese history. After all, she grew up the daughter of Chinese literary pioneer and Nanyang Siang Pau editor-in-chief, Lien Shih Sheng. In contrast, she knew very little about the histories and cultures of the rest of Asia until she started volunteering. From giving regular Mandarin tours of the ACM’s permanent collection as well as past special exhibitions, such as Cities & Kings: Ancient Treasures from Myanmar and Christianity in Asia: Sacred Art and Visual Splendour, Wen Sze has come to understand the commonalities that bind this region. A recent discovery she made is how many capitals of Southeast Asia—Bangkok, Singapore, Jakarta, and Yangon—are located near the sea as this allowed their inhabitants to trade with others easily.\nMeticulous preparation\nEvery new exhibition at ACM gives Wen Sze the perfect excuse to buy books. This kickstarted a meticulous process of highlighting and footnoting, her method of identifying the building blocks for her historical tours. Wen Sze views history as a backdrop to our present. She believes the historical backdrop will help museum visitors understand the exhibited artefacts. For instance, visitors to the Joseon Korea: Court Treasures and City Life exhibition may be puzzled about why many of these artefacts from Korea are filled with Chinese characters. She explains to them that this is because the kingdom encouraged the spread of Chinese Confucian ideals and doctrines.\n“If I just learn the artefacts without knowing the history, I’m not a good docent,” she says. “Anybody can just read the panel texts; I feel I need to fill in and make the connections.”\nSuch an analytical take on heritage stems from Wen Sze having a PhD in Chemistry and a post-graduate diploma in Business Administration. Working as a food scientist has also taught her to research in a methodical manner, and to be aware of histories and different cultures. Wen Sze has also contributed to food science education and training, having taught in universities in both Singapore and China. “Even when you develop a food product for a nation, you have to understand its culture,” she explains.\nDespite having switched her devotion in life from science to heritage, Wen Sze says it has not only been easy but also a good change in lifestyle pace. Unlike the rapid changes in science and technology that required her to keep up with the latest developments, she enjoys how heritage moves slower as it is a “precipitation of culture”. She adds with a laugh, “It won’t go away. You can just add on and add on, so it is more rewarding especially for older people as we can’t run that fast now.”\nIn fact, this was hardly the case when I went on a tour led by Wen Sze. The bespectacled lady with a short crop of hair zipped through the exhibition of over 150 artefacts from South Korea’s national museums, hardly breaking a sweat. Even though she is a Mandarin Guide, Wen Sze also gamely added English translations when some of her visitors asked for it. And, after walking and speaking for more than an hour, she was still ever ready to answer questions from visitors.\nBeyond the fascinating artefacts in the museum, it is clear that Wen Sze is also energised by the interactions with visitors on her tours. One of her most memorable experiences was taking the Literature Nobel laureate Mo Yan on a private tour of ACM when he was in town. Despite it not being his first time, the Chinese novelist praised her for proving to him how good the museum’s collection was.\n“We have many good museums, and there are so many treasures in them,” says Wen Sze. “That is why we must do our part to let visiting museums become a national pastime!”\nBy Justin Zhuang", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/heritage-volunteers-lien-wen-sze/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/heritage-volunteers/07-lien-wen-sze/lien-wen-sze-1_ca8a5825-(1).ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:38"},

But, as Belinda Mock sees it, Singapore’s past is very much breathing and alive. Visitors to a museum would expect to be taken into the depths of history. But, as Belinda Mock sees it, Singapore's past is very much breathing and alive.\nAt a tour of the Singapore History Gallery, the veteran docent does not shy from a personal script. Her father, like many first-generation Singaporeans, arrived by boat while escaping the Sino-Japanese war in China, Belinda shares.\nThat was why Japanese soldiers thought the local Chinese were anti-Japanese supporters during World War II in Singapore, she adds. They targeted Chinese males at Operation Sook Ching, which resulted in tens of thousands of deaths.\n“I want visitors to realise that I'm not just presenting something that I read or heard about. My ancestors were part of Singapore's history. I am the end product of their experiences,” she explained.\nBelinda loves talking about the city-state's rise as a bustling metropolis. These are the final sections of the gallery, located at the National Museum of Singapore. “Many visitors are in awe of how Singapore is peaceful, multiracial, and successful even though it is a small country,” she said.\nShe gives credit to the government for being able to change public perceptions when needed. For instance, there were student riots when the British first introduced national service in the 1950s. So, Singapore leaders took time to broach the subject after the country became independent, Belinda said. They eventually made national service compulsory in 1967.\nThere were attractive incentives for starting a military career—enough to convince Belinda, then a fresh jobseeker, to sign up. She became an officer with the Republic of Singapore Air Force.\n“Visitors will look at me and think: ‘Wow, you were an officer?’ In the old days, people thought that the army was not a respectable way to make a living. Now, Singaporeans have grown to respect the military forces.”\n“It’s my personal way of explaining that Singapore is successful because people have opportunities to do anything that they set their minds to,” Belinda reflected.\nA passion out of work\nToday, Belinda does marketing for an IT company. She leads two tours every Saturday, at heritage institutions including the National Museum of Singapore, Former Ford Factory, Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall, and Asian Civilisations Museum. Sunday is her family day.\nThis has been the arrangement since 2004, when she started training as a docent with Museum Volunteers. The group is made up of around 200 English-speaking guides. Most of the members are Singaporeans holding full-time jobs, who share a passion for heritage, culture and the arts.\n“As a museum docent, you get to learn about artefacts from the experts, before doing your own research for tours. For blockbuster exhibitions, an overseas curator may even come to Singapore to take us around,” Belinda said.\nAt times, members organise trips to exhibitions’ countries of origin. Notably, blockbusters are a chance for docents to get to know each other better and work as a team. “After an hour of guiding, we would probably lose our voices and go for afternoon tea or a drink,” Belinda said. The group also holds a traditional “exhibition sending off” potluck.\nIn 2014, Belinda took a break from work. She spent a very busy year as the President of Museum Volunteers before returning to the workplace.\nPreparation for any exhibition is a lengthy process. After doing research, Belinda comes up with a detailed tour paper with varying stops, depending on the age range of visitors.\n“To keep dementia away, people always recommend playing mahjong. I'd say volunteer as a docent. Every few months, a fresh exhibition forces you to learn something new. It keeps your mind moving,” she shared.\nMuseum culture\nThe rise in museum visitorship is encouraging for docents, Belinda said. When she first started, there were occasions where her tours had no takers. Now, she typically addresses a group of between 10 and 20 people on a Saturday.\n“As Singapore develops and aspires to become a first-world nation, culture plays a large part. It is cool to be seen visiting museums. People like watching musicals and plays,” Belinda said. “These activities have become part and parcel of life, more so than the previous generation. I am very fortunate to be able to witness this change.”\nBelinda inspired two of her colleagues at work to join the Museum Volunteers, and they are now actively guiding at the National Museum of Singapore. Beyond guiding, Belinda goes the extra mile by lingering after tours to talk to visitors. Some tourists ask her for food recommendations. Others need her help with directions, or recommendations for attractions to visit.\nBelinda's advice for heritage lovers? “Try being a docent, especially if you love to share your experiences with others,” she said. “At the end of the day, you can inspire people through the stories that you tell.”\nBy Annabelle Liang", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/heritage-volunteers-belinda-mock/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/heritage-volunteers/04-belinda-mock/01-belinda-mock.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:38"},

Decades after she left academia and travelled across the world, Patricia has found the perfect combination for her education and experience in being a volunteer docent. Once a teacher, always a teacher—the phrase resonates with Patricia Welch. Formerly a lecturer of Chinese history and religion at Boston University, she had left the job for a series of marketing roles.\nDecades later and miles across the world, Patricia has found a way back to the profession. Now, she spends most of her time voluntarily training docents, who lead tours at nine museums and cultural institutions around Singapore.\n“Although I left academia to work in the private sector, I always knew I wanted to return to that field. I believe in community service, but felt it was also important to use the skills and knowledge that I had acquired in the field of Asian art,” Patricia said.\n“Being a volunteer docent—and given my education and experience, a trainer of docents—is, for me, the perfect combination,” she added.\nBorn in Wisconsin and raised in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Patricia was aged 18 and a pre-medical student when she discovered a love for Asian history. “I have no idea what it was. Something just hit me right away, and I fell in love,” she said.\nPatricia switched majors to Asian Studies at Boston University, where she also attained her Master’s Degree before continuing Chinese Studies at the University of Oslo, Norway.\nIn the late 1980s, she relocated to Bangkok, and signed up as a volunteer guide at its National Museum. When Patricia moved to Singapore in 1994, she was on the lookout for similar opportunities.\nThat was when she discovered Friends of the Museums (FOM), a non-profit organisation with nearly 2,000 members. The organisation provides financial support and weekday guiding services to museums and cultural institutions.\n“Although I was working full-time, Friends offered free Monday Morning lectures and a large array of other activities, including study groups and tours, so I joined,” she said.\nFrom docent to trainer\nShe has not looked back. Besides joining FOM, Patricia also became a member of the Museum Volunteers, a community of English-speaking guides who give tours on the weekends. Now that she is retired from full-time employment, she guides for both FOM and the Museum Volunteers.\n“More than half of my friends in Singapore are fellow volunteers because that’s where we met! Volunteering is a great way to meet like-minded people,” Patricia shared.\nMost docents giving tours on weekdays are expatriates like Patricia. “So, don't be surprised if you visit, say the Indian Heritage Centre, and find your guide a German or Brazilian,” she said.\nGuiding at the Asian Civilisations Museum is among her favourite experiences. Visitors are given a glimpse of Singapore as an “ancient emporia” for the trading of goods. For instance, ivory from Africa passed through the city-state before being carved by the Chinese, Patricia explained.\n“There are many stories that should be shared. Guiding is a pure joy, to be able to share knowledge and light that spark of interest in visitors,” she said. “It's a wonderful feeling when they come back and ask, ‘Where should I go next?’”\nIn 2015, she became involved in the training of FOM docents at institutions such as the Asian Civilisations Museum, Peranakan Museum, and Singapore Art Museum. Patricia also served on the FOM Council and was FOM’s webmaster for three years.\nIn 2016, Patricia was appointed Co-head of Overall Docent Training. She spends most of her time structuring and coordinating preparatory programmes which can be completed in 8 to 24 weeks.\n“When we review applicants, we look for people who like being with people, who are keen to learn and make learning fun. We assume no prior knowledge whatsoever, which is why we have a large number of non-Singaporeans who also volunteer for our programmes,” Patricia said.\n“Don't hesitate. As long as you have intellectual curiosity, being a volunteer docent or guide is very fulfilling.”\nOn top of guiding and training docents, Patricia also leads study tours to China for FOM.\nInspiring others\nVolunteering is a family affair in the Welch household. Patricia's husband volunteers in his areas of expertise, primarily sitting on academic advisories.\nBoth her daughters have careers in the field of social work. One is a psychologist working primarily with young people. The second works with paperless refugees in Europe. They are also active volunteers in their free time, working with displaced and special-needs individuals, Patricia shared.\nThe small moments of guiding are close to her heart. Once, Patricia had a seven-year-old visitor on a tour around the Asian Civilisations Museum.\n“I chose to speak to the girl, rather than leave her out. I told her that being interested in history requires some detective work. By looking at a statue, you can figure out what people wore, did and thought about life,” she said.\n“I was using the words 'archaeology' and 'archaeologist' a lot,” Patricia added. “At the end of the tour, she told her mother that she wanted to become an archaeologist. It's a moment that I'll always remember.”\nBy Annabelle Liang", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/heritage-volunteers-patricia-welch/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/heritage-volunteers/05-patricia-welch/01-patricia-welch.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:39"},

Their shop, Lam Yeo Coffee Powder, has been around since 1959.\n\nWatch: An Encounter with a Street Barber\nStreet barbers such as Lee Yong Tong, who has been in the trade for more than 50 years are now very much a rarity that cater to a small but loyal following.\nMany of these traditional trades arose in the early days of Singapore’s history as a means of survival. Though some were undoubtedly influenced from skills and cultures adapted from their respective homelands, a majority were developed to meet the needs of a rapidly increasing population and changing society.\nTraditional trades and the craftsmen that practice it were visible in all sectors of Singapore’s socio-economic landscape ranging from food and trade, to lifestyle and entertainment. Though many of these craftsmen and their trades have since vanished, their ability to adapt their skills and businesses to the changing landscape till this day is a testament to their continued ingenuity and perseverance.\nThe Craftsmen\nBefore the days of street art and computer graphic design, hand-painted movie posters were all the rage, especially during the era of Singapore’s Golden Age of Cinema. Hand-drawn movie poster painters like Ang Hao Sai, who first became an apprentice in a poster studio in 1963, were in great demand to help churn out promotional posters for films produced by the likes of Cathay Keris and Shaw Brothers’ Studio. Although Ang closed his studio in 1987, he has reinvented his business and has continued in his craft till today.\nMr Ang Hao Sai first became an apprentice at a poster studio in 1963 at a time of Singapore’s Golden Age in Cinema. His own studio had to close down in 1987 but he has since reinvented himself to meet the demands of a modern society.\nOn a more personal note, Letter writers such as Mr. Thangaraju, who first came to Singapore from South India in 1951, provided an affordable means of communication between immigrants and their families back home at a time when long-distance phone calls and formal education were a rarity. For him, his own experience as an immigrant undoubtedly helped to lend a sense of empathy to the letters he wrote. Letter writing slowly died out in the 1970s due to lack of clients and improving education in Singapore.\nThe story of Singapore’s infrastructure would not be complete without the contributions of Samsui women such as Ms Ng Moey Chye. Along with many others who hailed from the sanshui (Samsui in Cantonese) region in China, she would carry heavy loads of bricks and construction material to-and-fro work sites between Chinatown and Collyer Quay, while donning the iconic red headscarf that ensured their visibility at work sites while storing their personal belongings all at once.\nOn the domestic front, Urut ladies, or Malay midwifes, such as Madam Runtia Binte Murtono played an important role in helping new mothers through their first few months after delivering by conducting traditional post-natal rituals. This included urut, a traditional massage technique handed down by word of mouth from generation to generation.\nStill holding strong\nWhile many traditional trades and craftsmen have since retired or developed into other trades, a good few such as the Bumboat operators of Pulau Ubin, Traditional confectioneries and Second-hand book sellers continue to provide daily necessities and services to a small but grateful audience. Their contribution to Singapore’s rich cultural heritage and entrepreneurial spirit is an invaluable asset that contributes not just to the socio-economic makeup of our society, but the identity of Singapore as nation.\nWatch: The Boat Operators of Pulau Ubin\nFor boat operators like Jie Gao Cai, life on the seas started way back when he was just 14 years old as a crew members on board one of the bumboats. He received his manning license at the age of 18 and has been a boat operator ever since.\nWatch: A Traditional Teochew Confectionary\nFor family businesses like Gin Thye Cake Maker who have been around since 1964, the attention to ingredients, recipes and techniques help ensure that customers get only the freshest and most delicious confections.\nGoldsmiths were a common sight along Buffalo Road during the 1960s.

Essays on him usually focus on his experimental spirit and formalistic innovations, often highlighting his synthesis of Western and Chinese art traditions. For an artist whose practice was so rich and diverse, there remain many fertile areas for future research, of which art patronage is one.\nArtists do not live in a vacuum. In early 20th century Singapore, many China-born and trained artists such as Cheong had to initially make a living by teaching art full-time, either in an academy like the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) or local schools. This meant that they had little time for their own practice. Amongst the early NAFA lecturers in the 1940s and 1950s, only a few such as Cheong and Chen Wen Hsi (1906-1991) eventually had the good fortune of early retirement to become full-time artists. Nevertheless, they had to continue to give private art tuition, work on commissions or even start businesses (as in the case of Chen who owned two art galleries) to ensure an alternative income source. What gave them the confidence to give up their full-time jobs to pursue art must, in part, have been the support they received in Singapore and abroad from patrons whom they could count on to either buy their works or recommend them to other collectors.\nIn Cheong’s case, he started teaching at NAFA in 1947, one year after settling down in Singapore. He eventually left his job in 1961. Between 1946 and 1961, he held three successful solo shows in Singapore (1956), Kuala Lumpur and Penang (1957). He later travelled to Europe for two years and held exhibitions in London (Frost and Reed Gallery, 1962; Redfern Gallery, 1963), Munich (Galerie Schöninger, 1962) and Oxford (Bear Lane Gallery, 1963). In 1962, he was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal by the Government of the State of Singapore. He was later honoured in 1967 with a retrospective exhibition at the National Art Gallery in Kuala Lumpur (his 12th solo show) in celebration of his 50th birthday and 25 years as an art teacher.\nThe support he received from patrons between the late 1940s and the early 1960s likely gave him the confidence and means to become a full-time artist who could travel around the world. This essay is a preliminary examination of Cheong’s practice in relation to the burgeoning art market during this period and especially his ties with a key patron from that era – Dato Loke Wan Tho. In particular, it will analyse some of Cheong’s works that were collected and later donated by Loke and his estate to the then National Museum of Singapore (now part of the National Heritage Board collection). Hopefully, future research will throw greater light on the critical roles played by various patrons in the development of Cheong’s practice and the reception of his works in Singapore and abroad.\nCheong Soo Pieng, Untitled (Girl with Birdcage), Undated, 85 x 44 cm, Watercolour on paper. Donated by Loke Wan Tho's Collection, Collection of National Heritage Board.\nArt Scene in Singapore\nAfter the devastation caused by World War II in Singapore, the local art scene slowly regained its footing. In 1946, teaching resumed at NAFA where Cheong became a teacher a year later. During that period, art groups like the Society of Chinese Artists re-established themselves, whilst new ones like the Singapore Art Society (SAS) and Society of Malay Artists (Persekutuan Pelukis Melayu) were set up in 1949. Such societies provided much-needed platforms for artistic exchange and joint exhibitions.\nWith the erosion of ties with China especially after the start of communist rule in 1949, the idea of a regional Malayan or Nanyang1 identity began to take root amongst the Chinese in Singapore. They started to identify themselves with the region, rather than the place of their birth. This was especially evident in literature and later, the visual arts. Interestingly, the need for a Malayan identity was also echoed by the British colonial government then. The Malayan Emergency took place from 1948 to 1960, during which the British government imposed severe measures to counter the communist insurgency in Malaya. The British also embarked on a cultural strategy to win the hearts and minds of the Malayan public against acts of terror by the Malayan Communist Party. In order to achieve this, the British hoped to create a shared Malayan culture to unite the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Brunei, Sarawak and North Borneo to stand against the Communist threat. Hence, the authorities worked closely with organisations like the SAS. For instance, in the 1950s, the British Council Hall was made available to many cultural and welfare groups, and the SAS even had its administrative office in the council premises.\nIn the 1950s, the concept of regionalism also dovetailed with growing nationalist sentiments and calls for decolonisation in the region as Singapore moved towards independence in 1965. This need for a Malayan identity continued even after Singapore gained self-government in 1959. One of the first ministries the new local government set up was the Ministry of Culture which was “vested with responsibility of formulating policies needed to create a common Malayan culture”.2\nArt Market In Singapore\nThe abovementioned circumstances brought forth a flurry of exhibitions in Singapore, especially those organised by groups such as SAS. An editorial entitled “Singapore Wakes Up” in the 1955 SAS magazine reported, “It is probable that visual arts have received more attention and publicity in Singapore in the first eight weeks of 1955 than in any corresponding period in local history. There have been seven exhibitions, seven broadcasts, six public lectures, an unprecedented number of meetings of the various committees of Singapore Art Society, and The Singapore Artist has been widely bought and read.”3\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, there were no private art galleries in Singapore. Although venues like the Straits Commercial Art Company shop provided some space for artists like Cheong to display paintings, their primary business was not the sale of artworks. So, in those early years, exhibitions such as those organised by SAS provided critical opportunities for artists to show and sell their works to the public. For instance, the first exhibition held by SAS in 1950 featuring 278 works by 76 local artists, attracted over 6500 visitors and garnered sales of $3363.4\nThe buyers of such works then were mostly European expatriates and affluent locals. Amongst the more prominent in the former group were art promoter Frank Sullivan5 and art historian Michael Sullivan.6 In the latter group, the most famous was Dato Loke Wan Tho. Although there were other well-known collectors in Malaya then, like Tan Tsze Chor and Wong Man Sze, they tended to collect only Chinese art and antiquities, and had few or no works by contemporary Malayan artists like Cheong. The one exception was Loh Cheng Chuan from Penang who was not only a well-known collector of Chinese art but also a keen patron of local artists.\nA Key Patron of The Era: Loke Wan Tho (1915 - 1964)\nTo many, the late Dato Loke Wan Tho is best known for leading the Cathay Organisation to become an important producer and distributor of Malay and Chinese films in the 1940s and 1950s. His regional business empire included cinemas, film studios and hotels. He was a much sought-after public figure and chairman of major institutions such as the Malayan Airways Ltd and Singapore Telephone Board. Often seen in the company of high government officials and glamorous film stars, he was very much one of the leading members of the Malayan establishment then.\nChua Mia Tee, Portrait of Dato Loke Wan Tho, 1995, Oil on canvas, 89 x 59 cm, Collection of National Heritage Board.\nLoke was a man of diverse interests and talents. A keen sportsman, he had a great love for nature. He was an accomplished ornithologist and photographer, and combined both interests to become an award-winning photographer of birds. Loke was also known as a great philanthropist. In particular, he was a tireless supporter of the arts and gave generously of his time and collections to various museums. Through his gifts, Loke supported the founding of the University Art Museum at the University of Malaya in the 1950s.7 As a collector, his interests were eclectic, ranging from Chinese ceramics8 to local modern art. In the latter, he was ably assisted by his personal secretary of 24 years, Ms Ann Talbot-Smith (1905-1983), who was herself also greatly interested in local artists.9\nA sampling of Loke’s activities as an art patron in the 1950s and 1960s reveals that he was supportive of a wide range of local artists. He was the guest of honour for the opening of exhibitions by established artists such as Chen Wen Hsi10 as well as younger ones like Lu Chon Min.11 For the latter group, these shows mattered a great deal as the artists often relied on the sales proceeds of such exhibitions to fund their overseas studies.12\nBy the early 1950s, Loke was already active with the SAS, having organised its first photographic exhibition with his good friend and SAS president Dr Carl Gibson-Hill in 1950. And Loke continued to maintain close ties with the SAS through the 1950s and early 1960s. For instance, besides serving as patron of the society in 1960,13 he also opened many of its shows as guest of honour and bought many works at such events. Loke’s secretary Talbot-Smith was also closely associated with the SAS, having served as its secretary for a time.14\nBy the late 1950s, Loke was regarded as having Singapore’s largest collection of works by local artists, numbering some 80 works. This was later augmented in 1957 by his purchase of another 64 works from Frank Sullivan who was then SAS vice-president.15 Loke had planned to display them with his own collection in Singapore’s first community art gallery.16 This eventually culminated in Loke’s decision to donate 99 paintings to the Ministry of Culture in 1960. The list of donated works by 50 artists included well-known names like Cheong as well as younger ones like Thomas Yeo.17 In 1962, Loke added 15 more paintings to the earlier 99 he gave.18 And after Loke’s untimely demise in 1964, his estate made another gift of his collection to the state.\nArtist And Patron\nWhen Cheong arrived from China in 1946, Loke was already based in Singapore, reviving his family’s cinema business after the war. At that time, Cheong was busy teaching at NAFA and had not yet had his first solo show in 1956. Although it is not clear when Loke first met Cheong, the latter was already taking part in group exhibitions then.19 Hence, it is likely that, given his interest in art, Loke would have encountered Cheong’s works at annual group exhibitions such as the one organised by the prominent Society of Chinese Artists in 1948 which featured an oil painting by Cheong of a female bather rendered in a cubist-like manner.20 In 1951, Cheong teamed up with Chen Wen Hsi, Chen Chong Swee and Liu Kang, to present a group show called Four Artists from China organised by SAS.21 The same four artists held another group exhibition in 1953 under the auspices of SAS, after their 1952 trip to Bali. Again, it is highly probable that Loke, given his ties with SAS, would have heard of, if not seen Cheong’s works at both shows.\nAmongst the works by Cheong donated by Loke, the earliest painting is Indian Men with Two Cows (1949). This was listed as ‘Kampong Scene’ and already in Loke’s collection when it was exhibited by the SAS in an exhibition titled Ten Years of Art in Singapore in 1956. However, it still does not provide the date of Loke’s first purchase of Cheong’s works as the painting could have been bought at any time between 1949 and 1956.\nCheong Soo Pieng, Indian Men with Two Cows, 1949. Oil on board, 76 x 105 cm. Donated by Loke Wan Tho's Collection Collection of National Heritage Board.\nHowever, there is an ink portrait by Cheong of Loke’s second wife – the beautiful and glamorous Christina Lee – completed in 1953. This indicates that at least, by the early 1950s, Cheong was familiar enough with Loke to have completed a portrait of the latter’s wife.\nCheong Soo Pieng, Portrait of Christina Lee, 1953. Ink and colour on paper, 75 x 54 cm, Collection of National Heritage Board.\nApart from Cheong, Christina Lee was known to have posed for a number of famous artists including Xu Beihong, Basoeki Abdullah, Lee Man Fong and Sun Yee.22\nBasoeki Abdullah, Untitled (Chinese Woman in White Cheongsum), Pastel, 66 x 51 cm\nCollection of National Heritage Board.\nXu Beihong, Portrait of Christina Lee, 1939, 82 x 54 cm, Oil on canvas. Collection of Xu Beihong Museum.\nThree years later in 1956, Loke was the guest of honour at the opening of Cheong’s first solo show in Singapore. Organised by SAS at the British Council Gallery, the show featured a wide range of media, including oils, watercolours, batik, gouache, Chinese ink and sketches. It is helpful here to highlight the close connection between Loke and Frank Sullivan, as the latter was the SAS exhibition organiser for the said show. And again in 1963, Loke opened Cheong’s exhibition at the Victoria Memorial Hall in Singapore, showing mostly works completed after the artist’s trip to Europe in the preceding two years. The fact that Cheong invited Loke to be the guest of honour at his first solo show in Singapore and that Loke, a highly-regarded personality, twice agreed to officiate at Cheong’s shows, testify to the growing relationship between the two men.\n(From left to right) Ho Kok Hoe, Cheong Soo Pieng, Mrs Cheong, Mrs Loke and Dato Loke Wan Tho at the artist's exhibition opening in 1963. Photograph from Cheong Soo Pieng catalogue (1991).\nIt is highly probable that Loke would have shown his encouragement by purchasing Cheong’s works at such openings. By the 1950s, Loke was widely known in the art circles for his admiration and support of Cheong. He reportedly bought two to three paintings by Cheong every month and hung them in his office. Loke also gave some of those paintings to his business partners in Europe.23 Cheong’s daughter Leng Guat recalled that Loke’s secretary Talbot-Smith used to visit her father’s studio periodically to select paintings, usually Chinese ink, for such gifts.24  Talbot-Smith also sometimes brought Cathay’s guests to meet Cheong in his studio.25 His student Thomas Yeo recalled that in the late 1950s, many of Cheong’s collectors were either British expatriates living in Singapore or friends introduced by Loke. Occasionally, Frank Sullivan and Michael Sullivan also brought visitors to his studio.26\nA number of Cheong’s mural commissions in the 1950s and 1960s such as those for Cathay Organisation (1955) and Singapore Telephone Board (1959), were also likely made possible through Loke’s connections.27 Loke’s support of Cheong in the 1950s during the Emergency period was helpful as this was a period when the British colonial government was generally suspicious of artists from China.28 Loke was well-regarded by the British elite in Singapore and on good terms with the then Commissioner-General for the United Kingdom in South East Asia, Malcolm MacDonald.29 The latter, who was also an admirer of Cheong’s works, bought paintings for his own collection as well as to give to friends during his tenure in Singapore between 1946 and 1955.30\nOver time, Loke and Cheong developed a warm and easy-going relationship. They met fairly regularly, usually conversing in Cantonese. The Cheong family used to visit the Lokes during Chinese New Year.31 Cheong also dropped in, sometimes unannounced, on Loke at his Cathay office to either show new works, or introduce promising young artists to him. Despite his busy schedule, Loke often made time to meet Cheong.32 By the time Cheong left for Europe in 1962, he was already quite a successful artist and sufficiently well off to embark on a two-year long trip.33 Loke continued his support in various ways. During Cheong’s European trip, Loke together with others, helped to effect introductions to London galleries such as Frost and Reed, and Redfern, where Cheong eventually held his exhibitions.34 Through his networks with the media industry, Loke was also able to arrange a TV interview for Cheong in the United Kingdom.35 In addition, Loke used his wide business contacts to introduce Cheong to collectors in France and Italy.36\nThe Loke Collection\nThere are 12 works by Cheong in the NHB collection which were donated by Loke and his estate. Two paintings – Balinese Selling Toddy (1954) and Bali Beach (1955) – were most probably from the Frank Sullivan collection which Loke purchased in 1957.\nCheong Soo Pieng, Bali Beach, 1955, 50 x 63 cm, Oil on canvas, Donated by Loke Wan Tho's Bequest.

Collection of National Heritage Board.\nThese two works were likely acquired earlier by Sullivan when he helped to organise Cheong’s first solo show in Singapore in 1956.37 The 12 works do not represent an exhaustive list of Cheong’s paintings acquired by Loke. There are probably more works in the collections of Cathay Organisation and the extended Loke family.38 However, they do provide a useful glimpse into the range of paintings Cheong produced after his arrival in Singapore in 1946 and prior to Loke’s demise in 1964. They also reflect the types of works that attracted the attention of key patrons like Loke and Sullivan, and conceivably other collectors and admirers of the period. The latter would include personalities in Singapore such as Malcolm MacDonald, Michael Sullivan, Madeleine Enright, Ann Talbot-Smith and Ho Kok Hoe, and those in Malaysia like P.G. Lim, Kington Loo and Loh Cheng Chuan.39\nThe paintings, evenly divided between six works done in oils and the rest on paper (either Chinese ink or watercolours), amply demonstrate Cheong’s proficiency in both Western and Chinese art traditions. Figurative works predominate, with only two landscapes and one still-life. Most of the figurative paintings feature scenes based on rural life such as Indian men tending cows or a Balinese selling toddy (a form of coconut wine). Others highlight local women (be they Malay, Balinese or Kenyah) in traditional dress. In these pictures, the women are usually shown against a backdrop of Southeast Asian motifs like palm fronds, tropical fruits, painted boats and oral patterned batik (a form of wax-resist dyed fabric).\nThe two landscapes depict scenes drawn from Cheong’s immediate surroundings. One shows a row of riverside shophouses – most likely along Singapore River – with boats and cars in the foreground. The other captures rustic wooden houses nestled amongst coconut trees with two Malay women in the foreground. These subjects convey an identity that is distinctly Southeast Asian. Consider the painting of a street vendor surrounded by a crowd of onlookers. The hawker’s loose singlet and wide-brimmed hat, together with the adjacent shirtless boy, hint at the hot and humid setting of the scene. Likewise for the painting of Singapore River – whilst the building facades may look European, the colourful green and red tongkangs (a form of cargo boats) bobbing in the waters are a reminder that such vessels are usually only found in this part of the world.\nSuch localised or Malayan themes were adopted by many local artists from the 1940s to the 1960s, both in response to their immediate physical environment as well as the growing interest in asserting a local identity. Such subjects were also consistent with the then British colonial authority’s attempts to create a shared Malayan culture amongst the local populace. Many expatriate collectors would have, understandably, also preferred works with explicitly local subjects as a reminder of the times they had spent in the region. As one of Cheong’s admirers Malcolm MacDonald had put it, “...whenever I contemplate one or another of them (Cheong’s paintings) I imagine that I had suddenly dropped in at a kampong in Malaya, a sea-shore resort on Singapore island, or a Dayak longhouse in the jungly interior of Sarawak.”40 Such was the evocative powers of Cheong’s works!\nLastly, an examination of three paintings featuring female figures (Bali Beach, Woman Lying Down and Untitled [Girl with Birdcage]) reveals Cheong’s innovative approaches between the late 1940s and early 1960s, which so captured his patrons’ attention. Whilst all three ostensibly depict similar subjects, the media and styles could not be more different. In the painting Bali Beach, Cheong demonstrated his proficiency with a Western medium, namely oil, and the stylistic features of key Western movements such as Primitivism, Cubism, Fauvism and Expressionism. He moved away from a straightforward representation of two topless women by reducing the female forms into simple graceful lines. The latter recall the sculpted features of indigenous wooden figurines as well as the rustic quality of the local way of life. The beach setting is captured by blocks of roughly applied brown, ochre and cream paint.\nThe blocks in turn form an interlocking design of angular planes which convey the effect of shifting light cast upon an undulating surface. Cheong also used strong bold colours, forming exaggerated contrasts, in order to accentuate the intensity of light and decorativeness of the tropics. Whilst the two ladies repose serenely on the beach, there is a sense of immediacy as certain elements such the boat, the basket of fruits and the lying woman’s feet have been cropped out by the picture’s edge, akin to the framing of a camera’s lens. The scene also pulsates with tropical fervour through Cheong’s application of paint in strong expressive strokes. Details like the patterns on the sarong (a loose garment made of a long strip of cloth wrapped around the body) worn by the seated female are sketched with quick fluid flourishes, suggestive of an individualistic spontaneity.\nCheong was also equally at home with Chinese ink painting. In Woman Lying Down, he used the long horizontal format associated with Chinese traditional hand scrolls. The latter are conventionally associated with landscape painting where a viewer is meant to experience travelling through the mountains and rivers as the landscape is slowly unrolled with the scroll. However, in this case, Cheong chose the subject of a reclining female which is usually more associated with the Western figurative paintings of Gauguin or Matisse, both known for their depictions of females in exotic locales. In this picture, Cheong had conveyed the feminine charm of his model through soft lyrical lines in ink. The Southeast Asian setting was captured through his careful attention to the woman’s elongated ears weighed down by heavy earrings and her oral patterned sarong. The figure’s affinity to nature is suggested by the large banana leaf on which she rests, whilst her rural occupation seems to be hinted at, by what appears to be a round woven tray in the background. The relatively flat colour washes used for the figure are in sharp contrast with her background which is completely filled with varying shades of ink. These, apart from bringing the female form into sharp relief, also provides an amorphous setting that alternately suggests receding depth as well as shifting light and shadow, constantly in flux.\nCheong Soo Pieng, Woman Lying Down, 1949, 37.5 x 94.5 cm, Chinese ink and colour on paper, Donated by Loke Wan Tho's Collection. Collection of National Heritage Board.\nUnlike Woman Lying Down which is a fairly representational depiction of a female figure, Cheong used a very different approach in the third work Untitled (Girl with Birdcage). It is also an ink painting but this time, the vertical composition is akin to the traditional hanging scroll format. Here, a standing woman is seen in the foreground and her Southeast Asian setting is suggested by her dress and headwear. The female form is now somewhat distorted through the elongation of her neck and arms as well as her heavily lidded eyes. Another person is seen peering through a curtained window in the top left corner of the painting, beside which hangs two birdcages, a common sight in many rural Malay homes. In this work, Cheong departed from Chinese painting aesthetics which conventionally dictate that parts of the paper surface should be left unpainted to suggest the physical setting of subjects, be it the ground, sky or water. Here, Cheong had almost filled up the painting surface with a grid of heavy ink lines and blocks of greens, blues, purples, pinks, browns and greys. Most interestingly, Cheong integrated the two figures into the overall composition of rectilinear blocks, which even extended to the woman’s dress. The grid-like pattern recalls the abstract works of Mondrian but, at the same time, also conveys the patchwork quality seen in many wooden stilted houses in Malay villages. The latter often use wooden planks for construction of its walls, which are then painted in bright colours.\nCheong Soo Pieng, Untitled (Girl with Birdcage), Undated, 85 x 44 cm, Watercolour on paper, Donated by Loke Wan Tho's Collection. Collection of National Heritage Board.\nThese three works amply exemplify how Cheong was able to bring together diverse media, techniques and approaches drawn from many art traditions, in order to capture slices of Southeast Asian life. In an era where the modern artist was celebrated for innovation, Cheong was able to assert his identity as a modern Asian artist in several ways. Firstly, his links with Asia were maintained through his foundation in Chinese ink painting tradition. At the same time, he was able to demonstrate his knowledge of international trends, particularly in Western modern art, both in his oil paintings as well as his innovative Chinese paintings. Thirdly, his Southeast Asian subjects also reflected his immediate reality, both physical and social, which in turn helped to connect him with his audiences in Singapore. As the art historian Michael Sullivan had succinctly put it in 1960, “His work is modern, yet not beyond the understanding of people of any feeling. It is influenced by modern art, but is by no means an imitation of it. It depicts the Malayan scene and yet does not merely illustrate or record it. It is, in fact, a true expression of the feelings of an artist who is at one with the world he lives in.”41\nNote: The author wishes to express his appreciation to the following individuals who had kindly agreed to be interviewed for this essay: Ms Cheong Leng Guat, Mr Choy Weng Yang, Dr Ho Kok Hoe, Mr Tan Teo Kwang and Mr Thomas Yeo.\nTake a closer look at Singapore’s $50 currency note and you will see a detail from Cheong Soo Pieng’s ‘Drying Salted Fish’.

The word originates from the Latin term communicare, meaning to “share” or “make common”. By exploring the development of communication, we can chart mankind’s progress across the fields of science, history and technology.\nText by Chua Mei Lin\nBeMuse Volume 4 Issue 3 - Jul to Sep 2011\nWhat is communication? The word originates from the Latin term communicare, meaning to “share” or “make common”. By exploring the development of communication, we can chart mankind’s progress across the fields of science, history and technology.\nBefore the advent of writing, men gathered to narrate stories and exchange ideas. Some daily routines and annual occurrences were recorded on walls, stones and bones. Later, the written and printed word encouraged learning and more people participated in this form of communication. With a little help from electricity, words were then transmitted over greater distances.\nThe tools of communication have gone through amazing transformations. Without missing a step, we call, email or text each other. Communication engages people and it draws the world closer. In Message Me, a 2011 exhibition at the Singapore Philatelic Museum, we reflected on men’s ingenuity in overcoming obstacles in the effort to share and in keep in touch.\nCuneiform and Hieroglyphs\nIn the prehistoric era, men communicated by speaking. Individuals talked to other people around them but not to those who were far away. A man could use his memory to store some information for the future but he had no way of saving it in other forms. To preserve the stories they knew, early man drew simple pictures on cave walls. Over time, these images became more detailed and complex and started to represent animals and objects encountered by early men. This was the beginning of writing.\nClay remnants found in the Mesopotamia region show shapes of animals, food and clothes. Some of the earliest forms of writing can be traced to the Sumerians of Mesopotamia around 3,000 BCE. Clay was an early writing surface but it was not easy to use. Depending on the writing tool used, the lines could be of different thicknesses.\nInstead of curves, wedge-shaped lines were used. This wedge-shaped writing is known as cuneiform script.\nWhen cities were first built, their inhabitants began to specialise in different fields of work. Some became farmers or herders of animals, while others worked as craftsmen making pottery and baskets. Traders helped to exchange goods. Very often, the products of one city were traded in other towns. To keep track of these items and their movements, early traders used clay tablets to record their goods.\nHieroglyphic script appeared in Egypt around 3,100 BCE. The ancient Egyptians started with pictograms (picture signs) and phonograms (sound signs).\nIdeograms – signs that represent ideas or things – were introduced later.\nFor a long time, nobody could translate the hieroglyphs until the discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1799 by a French soldier with Napoleon’s army in Egypt. It took Frenchman Jean-François Champollion 15 years before he made the connections and deciphered the hieroglyphs in 1822.\nAlphabet and Writing\nNot everybody can draw, and given the sheer number of things to be represented, the alphabet was invented. The alphabet is a selection of consonant and vowel sounds which form words when strung together. The English language, for instance, comprises words made up of 26 letters. The Chinese written language uses nine basic strokes, but when combined, these create a vocabulary of more than 100,000 characters. In its simplest form, the Tamil language has 12 vowels, 18 consonants and one special character.\nWhat did man use to write in the early days? During the Stone Age, men wrote on pre-existing materials such as rocks, bones and cave walls. Clay tablets later provided a handy surface but were heavy and required laborious preparation before they could be used. The ancient Egyptians used papyrus, a paper-like material made from the pith of an aquatic sedge native to the Nile River. In the Middle Ages, leather and parchment made from animal skin were used for manuscripts. Around the 2nd century CE, Cai Lun, an official at the Chinese court of Emperor He of the eastern Han dynasty, invented paper. Europeans learnt about paper much later in the 12th century when the Venetian Marco Polo visited China.\nTo write, the ancient Egyptians used the trimmed ends of reeds. Metal styluses were used in the Roman Empire, but due to an alarmingly high number of stabbings, they were banned and replaced by bone and ivory tools. In the Middle Ages, writing was done using quill pens obtained from duck and goose feathers. A scribe would dip the sharpened end of the quill into a jar of ink, tap off the excess ink and put quill to paper. As quills wore out very quickly, some people turned to more lasting materials such as horn and tortoiseshell.\nMuch later, the Briton Samuel Harrison crafted pen points of metal in 1780 and this marked the birth of modern steel pens. The fountain pen was patented by Lewis Edson Waterman, an American, in 1884. With an internal reservoir of ink, this tool advanced the art of writing to a new level. In 1945, the Hungarian László József Bíró invented the portable and disposable ballpoint pen.\nLetters of Note\nEver since writing was invented, letters served to bridge distances between people. Letters nurtured relationships, maintained friendships, conveyed condolences and best wishes, and even provided missing pieces of information for historians and biographers of notable personalities.\nSome letters are serious and historic. For example, the physicist Albert Einstein wrote to US President Franklin Roosevelt in 1939 to warn him of the German government’s interest in developing atomic weapons. This letter prompted the formation of an Advisory Committee on Uranium and the start of America’s nuclear research programme.\nHow much is a love letter worth? A lot if you are John Keats, the great English poet of the Romantic Period. In March 2011, one of Keats’ love letters to his fiancée Frances (Fanny) Brawne fetched £96,000 at an auction in London.\nLetters also provided a means of communication for early migrants. In the 1800s, many Chinese men landed in Singapore to seek jobs. These manual workers and coolies were mostly illiterate. Letter writers were in great demand by migrants who wanted to send money and messages back to their families in China. These letters provided an essential lifeline and a source of comfort for the workers.\nPrinting and Typing\nBefore the invention of the printing press, books were written by hand. This made books very special and expensive. The Chinese invented block printing some time in the 8th century. To make copies, pictures and text were carved on wooden blocks. The blocks were first coated with ink and a piece of paper was laid the surface and pressed to transfer the contents of the print. In the 11th century, Pi Sheng, a Chinese, made individual clay types, the world’s first movable type. A movable type consists of individual letters or characters that can be assembled and rearranged to form different words and texts. Pi Sheng’s clay types, however, broke easily and the sheer number of characters in the Chinese language made it impossible to carve enough types.\nIn 1450, the German Johannes Gutenberg developed movable metal types for printing. Using this method, he invented a press that was used to create the first printed book, the two-volume Gutenberg Bible. Printing revolutionised communication. As books became affordable and common, more people learnt to read and write and the dissemination of new ideas, discoveries and information became faster and more widespread.\nThe typewriter was invented by Christopher Latham Sholes, an American newspaper editor, in 1868. The original keyboard, with a layout commonly known as QWERTY, is still in use today. This arrangement of the letters on the keyboard prevented typists from working too fast, which caused the keys on the machine to jam. Confusingly, the first people who used Sholes’ invention were also called typewriters. Only later were they known as typists.\nFrom Poniesto the Penny Post\nIn the old days, only royalty, religious leaders and the very rich could afford to send letters. Runners were employed to carry the letters. Later, horseback riders covered greater distances and achieved higher speeds using a relay system with fresh horses at regular stations. The most famous of these was the Pony Express of the American West. Another courier of correspondence and probably the earliest form of airmail was the carrier pigeon, which ferried messages attached to its legs or tail.\nOrdinary people relied on the goodwill of travellers to carry their letters. Sometimes, the letters failed to reach their destination. As more people became literate and communicated with each other, the penny post was introduced in 1683. For a penny, the London penny post would convey messages anywhere within the city of London. This was the beginning of a postal service for the masses.\nVery few people in ancient times knew how to read and write, including kings and queens. Scribes, people who specialised in writing, therefore played a very important role in ancient civilisations. They took note of offerings made at temples, recorded tributes paid to the rulers, wrote contracts and accounts for traders, penned wills and generated official correspondence.\nIn the Middle Ages, under the patronage of kings, wealthy nobles and powerful religious orders, scribes documented historical events, judicial and legal records, and copied books and sacred texts. But with the invention of printing in the 15th century, these professional writers soon lost their importance.\nSmoke and Mirrors\nSignals are messages communicated without words. Like doorbells and sirens, they usually convey only one simple message. Primitive tribes sent messages by beating drums which could be heard at a distance by other tribes. Signals that use visual means include smoke, fire and light. Native Americans used blankets to control the smoke over a fire as a method of sending messages to distant tribes. On a good day, these signals could be seen from afar. But this technique was not possible on windy days or at night.\nAnother way of sending messages was to reflect sunlight on mirrors. As early as the 5th century BC, the Greeks were already using sunlight reflected on metal mirrors to convey signals. In 1867, British Royal Navy Captain Philip Colomb introduced the use of a lantern to send messages from ship to ship. A few years later, the British inventor Arthur Aldis built an electrically powered signal lamp which was faster and brighter. Light continues to be a warning system in functions such as lighthouses and traffic lights.\nFlying the Flag\nSemaphore signalling uses an alphabet-based flag system. A signal man holds up two bi-coloured flags to indicate alphabets, numbers or a universal standard code. Naval communication flags have been used since the days of Christopher Columbus when he explored the New World.\nEnsigns are national flags displayed by ships to show their origin and status: friend or foe. Naval signal flags are governed by the International Code of Signals. Ship crews of all nationalities understand and use this universal messaging system. During Singapore’s early years, flags were flown at Fort Canning. They signalled the arrival of a ship with mail. A red ensign indicated the arrival of European ships while a yellow flag stood for ships from China. In the night, residents were informed of arriving mail by the firing of a gun.\nThe Birth of Modern Telecommunication\nIn the 1830s, the American inventor Samuel Morse devised the telegraph system and this marked the beginning of modern long-distance communication. Using electric currents to represent letters or numbers, an operator taps on a transmitter to produce short or long buzzes. A short buzz is called a dot and a long one is called a dash. Combined, these dots and dashes spell out a message. The most famous is the universal code dot-dot-dot, dash-dash-dash, dot-dot-dot for “SOS” in emergencies.\nIn Britain, the first successful telegraph line was built in 1837 by William Cooke and Charles Wheatstone. This system was originally used by railway operators to send messages to stations about train services. Later, underwater sea cables connected continents. The first telegraph link using this method was between Britain and France in 1850. A submarine telegraph link was eventually laid out between Europe and America after many unsuccessful attempts.\nSeveral inventors in America and Europe were developing the telephone at around the same time but it was Alexander Graham Bell who made the breakthrough in 1876. Bell allegedly cried, “Mr Watson, come here. I want you” when he spilled battery acid on his clothes. His colleague Thomas Watson, who was in the next room, heard Bell’s voice over a wire. Thus the telephone was invented.\nToday, instead of wires, our voices are converted into beams of light and transferred through thin strands of glass called optical fibres. It was said that in 1891, an American funeral parlour owner named Almon Strowger was so upset with the bad service of the switchboard telephone operators that he invented the automatic telephone exchange.\nNew Waves of Communication\nRadio waves travel through the air and do not need wires – making them very useful for establishing contact with airplanes and ships. Heinrich Hertz, a German physicist, discovered radio waves in the 1880s. Based on Hertz’s discovery, the Italian Guglielmo Marconi experimented with transmitting radio waves and successfully sent a “wireless telegraph” across the Atlantic Ocean in 1901.\nIn 1906, using radio waves, Canadian engineer Reginald Fessenden made the first radio broadcast of voice and music. As early as 1927, engineers were experimenting with sending pictures using radio waves. After solving some major technical difficulties, television broadcasting arrived in the houses of the general public in the late 1940s and quickly became the most popular form of home entertainment and communication in the 20th century.\nMaking Communication Mobile\nPrimitive mobile phones made their first appearance in the 1940s but it took another forty years before these devices became affordable and practical. Early mobile phones weighed about 34 kg and were mainly fitted in cars. Besides making calls, mobile phones today, or more correctly smart phones, are multiple usage devices. They enable us to send text and video messages, exchange email, browse the Internet, play games, capture images, make voice recordings, play music, listen to the radio and navigate using the global positioning system or GPS.\nThe first text message was apparently sent by Neil Papworth, a young test engineer, from his personal computer to a friend’s phone on Christmas 1992. Text messaging is probably the most highly used mobile data service. The activity is so popular that “texting” and other similar phrases have entered the mainstream lexicon. Interestingly, text messages and ancient Egyptian writing share a similarity – the use of rebus, meaning pictures or symbols that represent words. Text, numbers and pictures are often combined in a single message. For example, “i <3 u” uses the pictogram of a heart to represent love and convey a message that is simple and direct.\nOne-to-one communication is still prevalent, but staying in touch with large groups of people and the world en masse through mobile channels like Facebook and Twitter is becoming a major trend in smartphone usage.\nThe Internet, The World Wide Web and Email\nThe Internet has its origins in a 1950s military research project in the United States to counter Soviet missile threats. The early model was called SAGE; it had several keyboards and screens attached to one big computer. In 1969, the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network or ARPANET was built. It allowed scientists in the US Department of Defense to share information.\nThis was a new type of computer network that would not break down even if one or more of the computers did not work. Large universities and other research institutions joined the network and made it a worldwide system of interconnected networks and computers. The Internet was introduced to the public in 1983. With about 14 billion users today, the Internet can be described as a global system of interconnected networks and computers.\nThe World Wide Web or Web is a way for information to be retrieved and distributed over the Internet. In the early years of the ARPANET, to find information, one needed to know where to look and use complex computer codes. Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, changed this when he created the World Wide Web. Initially the Web was meant only for scientists but in 1991 it was made available to the public. The Web uses computer languages like http (short for hypertext transfer protocol) to send information. To call up pages with graphics, sound, text and video, users access the web through software called browsers such as Internet Explorer and Firefox.\nElectronic mail or email actually predates the Internet but it was the computer network at ARPANET that contributed to its development. Email started as a digital message board for scientists working on ARPANET where the @ address format was born.\nCommunication and You\nTechnology is advancing at an amazing pace and bringing people closer through faster and easier communication. With the advent of the Internet, all traditional forms of communications have become condensed and accelerated. Communication has become more rapid but not necessarily error-free.\nWhat is communication to you?\nChua Mei Lin is Curator, Singapore Philatelic Museum.", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/lets-talk-communication-across-history/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/lets-talk-communication-across-history/letstalkcommunicationacrosshistory1.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:40"},

Kelvin Ang loves old buildings. He has visited hundreds of Singaporean shophouses, bungalows, hotels, temples, churches, and mosques, and he is still fascinated by their beauty.\n“On an old building, you can see the handiwork of many anonymous craftsmen from centuries ago,” he says. “All these things are made by hand: the columns, the plasterwork flowers, the carvings on windows, and the choice of coloured glass.”\nHe notes that Singapore is a truly unique city because it contains architecture from all over the world. On a single street, you can find buildings that reflect traditions from Europe, China, India, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.\nThis is why he is trying to protect our built heritage. He works at the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), the government’s department for city planning, land use and conservation. His position is the Director of Conservation Management, which means that he is in charge of looking after our architecture for future generations.\nPart of his job is making sure that heritage buildings are not damaged. Sometimes, when people install windows, signs or air conditioners in an old building, they change its overall design. He has to tell these people to have the building changed back.\nReaching out\nAnother more interesting part of his job is education and outreach. “How do you make 7,000 heritage buildings meaningful to the population?” he asks. “We have to carry out programmes so that people can appreciate and enjoy these buildings.”\nOne of these programmes involves students from the Tourism Club of the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) College West. He has trained them to lead guided walks in Tiong Bahru, so that they can present the history of this neighbourhood to visitors.\nAnother programme involves young filmmakers from Nanyang Technological University. They create short documentaries about heritage buildings like the Hajjah Fatimah Mosque, and the Central Fire Station. You can watch these on URA’s YouTube channel.\nMr Ang believes that it is important for young people to have a connection to old buildings. But, this does not mean they must study facts about when these structures were built. It means they should spend time there, creating happy memories of their own.\nHe smiles whenever he sees folks taking graduation photos or selfies at old monuments. “They are making these places part of their personal life stories,” he says. “Without these stories, the buildings are just bricks and mortar.”\nVivid memories\nMr Ang was born in 1972. Like most Singaporeans, he grew up in an HDB estate. But, his mother often took him to Chinatown to visit friends and relatives. He was captivated by the sight of the crumbling old shophouses, and by the way people made use of the five-foot ways – the covered walkways between the buildings and the road.\n“The five-foot ways of Chinatown were a kaleidoscope of possible adventures,” he says. “Everything was on display: there were people trading, doing homework, telling fortunes.” He also has a vivid memory of visiting a shophouse that had been turned into a Taoist temple. It contained a holy python kept in a red metal cage. He could see a big lump in the python’s belly because it had just been fed a whole chicken.\nLooking back, he realises these childhood experiences gave him a special connection to Chinatown’s shophouses. “These buildings are important to me, not because of history books, but because they are part of my story as a citizen,” he says.\nAs a teenager, he discovered a book called Characters of Light: A Guide to the Buildings of Singapore by Marjorie Doggett. It was full of beautifully taken photographs of places like St Andrew’s Cathedral and Sri Mariamman Temple. Sharing it with his family members, he found that the photos made them talk about their own early memories. This was how he learned that art can play a part in preserving heritage.\nSpecial features\nBut, it was only after he started working for URA that he truly began to appreciate our architecture. He learned that many old buildings were specially designed to keep a space cool without the use of electricity. For instance, traditional shophouse windows have shutters made of slanted pieces of wood. They allow air and light to enter a room, but they also block out the rain and most of the heat.\nThe five-foot way was also designed to protect people from the rain and the sun. However, it functions as a public space as well, where strangers can bump into one another and become friends. A couple of Mr Ang’s friends met each other in the five-foot way, and later even got married!\nThis is an example of how architecture can actually build communities. “In a city of millions, you do need small spaces where it is more intimate,” he says. He firmly believes that today’s architects have a lot to learn from builders of the past.\nOf course, Singapore must change to keep up with the times.

Kelvin Ang loves old buildings. He has visited hundreds of Singaporean shophouses, bungalows, hotels, temples, churches, and mosques, and he is still fascinated by their beauty.\n“On an old building, you can see the handiwork of many anonymous craftsmen from centuries ago,” he says. “All these things are made by hand: the columns, the plasterwork flowers, the carvings on windows, and the choice of coloured glass.”\nHe notes that Singapore is a truly unique city because it contains architecture from all over the world. On a single street, you can find buildings that reflect traditions from Europe, China, India, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.\nThis is why he is trying to protect our built heritage. He works at the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), the government’s department for city planning, land use and conservation. His position is the Director of Conservation Management, which means that he is in charge of looking after our architecture for future generations.\nPart of his job is making sure that heritage buildings are not damaged. Sometimes, when people install windows, signs or air conditioners in an old building, they change its overall design. He has to tell these people to have the building changed back.\nReaching out\nAnother more interesting part of his job is education and outreach. “How do you make 7,000 heritage buildings meaningful to the population?” he asks. “We have to carry out programmes so that people can appreciate and enjoy these buildings.”\nOne of these programmes involves students from the Tourism Club of the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) College West. He has trained them to lead guided walks in Tiong Bahru, so that they can present the history of this neighbourhood to visitors.\nAnother programme involves young filmmakers from Nanyang Technological University. They create short documentaries about heritage buildings like the Hajjah Fatimah Mosque, and the Central Fire Station. You can watch these on URA’s YouTube channel.\nMr Ang believes that it is important for young people to have a connection to old buildings. But, this does not mean they must study facts about when these structures were built. It means they should spend time there, creating happy memories of their own.\nHe smiles whenever he sees folks taking graduation photos or selfies at old monuments. “They are making these places part of their personal life stories,” he says. “Without these stories, the buildings are just bricks and mortar.”\nVivid memories\nMr Ang was born in 1972. Like most Singaporeans, he grew up in an HDB estate. But, his mother often took him to Chinatown to visit friends and relatives. He was captivated by the sight of the crumbling old shophouses, and by the way people made use of the five-foot ways – the covered walkways between the buildings and the road.\n“The five-foot ways of Chinatown were a kaleidoscope of possible adventures,” he says. “Everything was on display: there were people trading, doing homework, telling fortunes.” He also has a vivid memory of visiting a shophouse that had been turned into a Taoist temple. It contained a holy python kept in a red metal cage. He could see a big lump in the python’s belly because it had just been fed a whole chicken.\nLooking back, he realises these childhood experiences gave him a special connection to Chinatown’s shophouses. “These buildings are important to me, not because of history books, but because they are part of my story as a citizen,” he says.\nAs a teenager, he discovered a book called Characters of Light: A Guide to the Buildings of Singapore by Marjorie Doggett. It was full of beautifully taken photographs of places like St Andrew’s Cathedral and Sri Mariamman Temple. Sharing it with his family members, he found that the photos made them talk about their own early memories. This was how he learned that art can play a part in preserving heritage.\nSpecial features\nBut, it was only after he started working for URA that he truly began to appreciate our architecture. He learned that many old buildings were specially designed to keep a space cool without the use of electricity. For instance, traditional shophouse windows have shutters made of slanted pieces of wood. They allow air and light to enter a room, but they also block out the rain and most of the heat.\nThe five-foot way was also designed to protect people from the rain and the sun. However, it functions as a public space as well, where strangers can bump into one another and become friends. A couple of Mr Ang’s friends met each other in the five-foot way, and later even got married!\nThis is an example of how architecture can actually build communities. “In a city of millions, you do need small spaces where it is more intimate,” he says. He firmly believes that today’s architects have a lot to learn from builders of the past.\nOf course, Singapore must change to keep up with the times. Sometimes, old buildings must be demolished so that new, modern buildings can take their place. Nevertheless, Mr Ang is working to ensure that some areas of the city remain the same, so that people can relive their memories whenever they pass them.\n“I have friends who took their wedding pictures at Cavenagh Bridge, and now whenever they cross the bridge, they think, ‘How nice, this place hasn’t really changed’,” he says. “It’s all very romantic.

The temple is dedicated to Guanyin, The Goddess of Mercy, but like many other Chinese temples in Singapore, it practises a mix of Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism. Location\nBuildings and Sites sksks\n31 Devonshire Road, Singapore 239851\nGet Directions\nTong Xian Tng Temple (同善堂) is a spinoff of Qing Lian Jiao (青莲教), a secretive folk religious sect founded in China during the Qing Dynasty. In Singapore, it has a much different character; focusing instead on charitable works and medical consultation, and open to public prayer.\nAccording to the inscription on the temple’s stone tablet, it was built in 1894. Its founder was a religious leader who hailed from Swatow, China — Ma Chun Qing (马纯清), also known as Master Beh Soon Cheng, or by his Taoist name, Dao Quan.\nThe construction of its two-storey building follows the traditional Teochew house form. At the front, the gateway is designed with cloud-like walls and an elaborately decorated Chinese roof, sheltering visitors from the elements. A plaque mounted on the ceiling of the front hall reads Wan Shan Tong Gui “万善同归”, which translates to “all good ends in the same path”.\nEarly Chinese settlers from the villages of South China tended to favour such buildings, as they adhered to the rules of the feudal hierarchical order set in place at the time, which dictated the scale and extent of embellishment. While Tong Xian Tng Temple followed closely to this tradition, it was also uniquely adapted to its sloping grounds.\nFor instance, the elevated site allowed for innovation in the design of the entrance. Its central stairway is flanked by sturdy walls and punctuated by green glazed ventilation grilles. As a result, the overarching aesthetic is novel, yet traditionally Chinese.\nFrom the late 1980s to the early 1990s, the temple underwent an extensive renovation, which resulted in the Ti Kong shrine being moved from the upper level to the right of the inner shrine hall.\nTong Xian Tng Temple, also known as the “Hall of Common Goodness”, is a zhaitang (斋堂) “vegetarian hall” in Mandarin, that became strongly associated with the Peranakan community from the late 19th century onwards and serves mainly the male Chinese Peranakan devotees of the Way of Former Heaven.\nThe temple’s association with the Peranakan community remains strong even today, with their presence more prevalent during Ti Kong Seh — Ti Kong ( in Hokkien) being the God of Heaven, whose birthday falls on the ninth day of Chinese New Year. On Ti Kong Seh, the temple’s regulars are offered vegetarian food to take home.\nThe temple is closely connected to two others established by the same founder in Singapore; namely Sian Teck Tng (善德堂) at Cuppage Road and Chek Sian Tng (积德堂) at Ang Mo Kio Street 44 (originally at Kramat Road).\nBuildings and sites featured on Roots.SG are part of our efforts to raise awareness of our heritage; a listing on Roots.SG does not imply any form of preservation or conservation status, unless it is mentioned in the article.

The definition of the term ‘Sam Kiang’ was also broadened to include immigrants from provinces along the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Heilongjiang.\nThe original office was located in Jalan Ampas for the convenience of the Sam Kiang clansmen; many of whom lived in the Tanglin and Orchard Road areas. Over the years, the association moved around various sites before calling the present-day Wilkie Road premises home on 15 July 1996.\nA Hybrid of Modern and Traditional Architecture\nLocated next to the Church of Christ of Malaya on Wilkie Road, Sam Kiang Huay Kwan is a two-storey shophouse with an overall architectural style that encompasses modernism with traditional Chinese elements. An arch is seen over the main entrance and a traditional Chinese name plague hangs over the main door.\nThe building has two frontages. The primary frontage which faces Wilkie Road, has a paved footpath, a double-pitched roof and aluminium framed glass doors and windows with pre-casted concrete vents. The rear frontage, with its lean-to roofs, faces Sophia Road, and serves as the entrance to the Sam Kiang Huay Kwan Charity Clinic.\nContributing to the Community\nUnder its longest serving President, Mr Chwee Meng Chong, the association founded many services and contributed charitably to the society.\nTo fund their charitable causes, the association proposed the development of the Sam Kiang Mansion in 1996. The $30 million project was completed in 1999 and spanned 20-storeys. The units were sold or rented out, and rental income was used to support the association’s recurrent expenditures, cultural, educational and welfare services.\nThe Sam Kiang Charity Clinic is one of their many charitable endeavours. Today, it continues to provide patients with better access to healthcare regardless of race.\nCentennial History of the Association\nTo celebrate their centennial history, the first Sam Kiang Clansmen International Convention cum centenary celebration was held on September 18, 2001. Guests from various Sam Kiang delegations in China, Malaysia, Australia, United States and Singapore came together to commemorate the momentous occasion.\nDuring the convention, the association released a souvenir volume titled ‘One Hundred Years’ Culture History of the Sam Kiang Clansmen’, documenting their migration, settlement and achievements.\nSam Kiang Huay Kwan’s contributions and efforts to support society, young or old, will continue to be remembered for years to come.\nBuildings and sites featured on Roots.SG are part of our efforts to raise awareness of our heritage; a listing on Roots.gov.sg does not imply any form of preservation or conservation status, unless it is mentioned in the article.

Text by David Alan Henkel\nImages courtesy of Asian Civilisations Musuem\nBeMuse Volume 5 Issue 1 - Jan to Mar 2012\nFor the better part of the past two millennia from the time of writing in 2012, India was a leading source of textiles for trade. Cotton cloth, along with a much smaller but highly valuable quantity of silk, was traded from production and distribution centres in Gujarat in northwest India and the Coromandel Coast in the southeast. Little known today, these textiles had a wide ranging and lasting impact on human civilisation in interesting and sometimes surprising ways. These textiles were the subject of the exhibition, Patterns of Trade: Indian Textiles for Export, 1400-1900, held at the Asian Civilisations Musuem until 3 June 2012.\nFragment: women battling a gajavyala (detail) Gujarat, 13th or 14th century, 104x154cm. Cotton; block printed, drawn and painted, resist and mordant dyed.\nEvidence from excavations in the Indus Valley dating back to about 4,500 years ago shows that Indians had already developed the technology to weave cotton into cloth at that time. Two thousand years ago, Indian artisans and traders had built on their knowledge, along with a parallel expertise in painting and dyeing cloth, to become the world’s leader in textile production. They had held this position until the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century.\nIndia’s advantage in textile production not only stemmed from its technological edge. The Indian subcontinent had a large population, which provided the workforce to perform the labour-intensive job of producing textiles. India also had ample land and a distinct dry season that made the region an ideal place to grow cotton. These advantages allowed Indian producers to manufacture a large surplus of cloth which it could trade to foreign markets.\nTextile production and major trade centres in the Indian subcontinent, 1600-1900.\nThe bulk of India’s textiles were cotton of modest quality – plain colours or simple, repetitive patterns of checks, stripes or floral lattices. These textiles were sold in foreign marketplaces more cheaply than cloth could be produced locally. At the other end of the market, India’s weavers and dyers were capable of producing cotton and silk textiles of exquisite quality and beauty.\nThe Indian textile industry was both productive and efficient. First, weavers living in or near cotton growing areas would process and weave the cotton into cloth. Next, the cloth would be graded; following which middlemen would purchase the cloth and send it to workshops for dyeing, printing and painting. Dyers had to be located near adequate sources of clean water to ensure the quality of the bright and colourfast dyes which India was famous for. After dyeing, the agents would sell the cloth to merchants heading to foreign ports. India’s traders had developed a sophisticated understanding of the markets they served, providing feedback to producers on the types and qualities of cloth that were most in demand. These merchants, often settled and had families in their host markets, knew the tastes of their customers and were able to relay information to the agents about what colours, designs, formats and levels of quality were most desirable. At the height of the Indian textile trade, merchants even brought back local designs and motifs which the painters and dyers faithfully copied.\nHanging (kain leluhur): large flowers and cartouches Coromandel Coast, 18th century. 171 x 277cm, Cotton; drawn and painted, resist and mordant dyed.\nThe earliest evidence we have on foreign trade of Indian textiles is in the Roman account of the first century. The Romans called Indian cotton “woven air”, in praise of its lightness and quality. These accounts described Indian cloth as a luxury good; however, the quantities were sufficient for Pliny the Elder to complain in 77 CE (Common Era) that Roman coffers were being emptied into India. Historical records from about the same period also mention Indian cotton being sent as gifts to the Emperor of China. The oldest examples of Indian cloth are fragments found at archaeological sites in Egypt, along the coast of the Red Sea at Berenike (old Bernice), and date to the fifth century. More fragments, which date from the ninth century, were excavated at Quesir Al Qadim and Fustat (Old Cairo).\nThe fragments found in Egypt are proof that trade in Indian cloth continued to flow even after Rome’s gradual decline. The Islamic world also embraced Indian textiles after its rise in the seventh century, and the new religion spread to both South and Southeast Asia along the same routes on which Indian textiles were traded. By the end of the 15th century, this robust and complex network had spread throughout the Indian Ocean basin and from the western coast of Africa to China.\nWhen the Portuguese captured Malacca in 1511, the Portuguese chronicler Tomé Pires estimated that the annual value of Malacca’s textile trade was worth 460,000 cruzados, the equivalent of almost 20 tonnes of silver. At that time, Malacca was one of the world’s richest cities, and Southeast Asia had grown to be a crucial market for Indian trade cloth. Island Southeast Asia was also the source of some of the world’s rarest and most desirable spices and aromatics, as well as other valuable commodities. Aside from the fragments found in Egypt, the earliest Indian trade textiles which survive today were found in the eastern half of the Indonesian Archipelago. These came from the remote islands of Maluku, as well as Timor and especially from the Toraja Highlands of Sulawesi. Some of these textiles have radiocarbon dates which range into the late 13th century.\nMaluku, a tiny cluster of islands in the far Eastern Archipelago, was for much of history the world’s only source of nutmeg, mace and cloves. These so-called “fine spices” were used to preserve and flavour food as well as for their perceived medicinal powers. For centuries, these spices were literally worth their weight in gold in the West. Not surprisingly, traders flocked to the islands, bringing with them Indian cloth which were highly prized by the islanders.\nWhile Maluku was more important economically during the time of the spice trade, it is Toraja which is the source of most of the earliest trade textiles that have been found. The Toraja called these textiles ma’a or mawa and believed that they served as a sacred bridge to the afterlife. Ma’a were used in funerals and other rituals and allowed the Toraja to interact and communicate with their ancestors. After the Dutch took control of the coastal ports of Sulawesi, the Toraja became isolated from the outside world and could no longer replace their Indian cloth. Instead they had to carefully preserve these textiles for generations, whereas in most other areas the cloths eventually disintegrated, were lost or replaced.\nEarly inscriptions found at archaeological sites clearly indicate that Indian cloth had been traded into Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, Borneo and Java in as early as the ninth century. The earliest and finest pieces discovered in this area, however, date from the 17th and 18th centuries. These were found in the remote interior areas of kampung and Jambi in southern Sumatra, and almost all originated from the Coromandel Coast.\nSkirt cloth (kain leluhur): patchwork centerfield Coromandel Coast, 17th or 18th century, 223x422cm, Cotton; drawn and painted, resist and mordant dyed.\nThe reasons for this are complex. For one, the pepper boom of the 17th century had significantly increased the flow of cloth into the region during this period. More importantly, large amounts of top quality cloth were brought in by traders as gifts to local rulers. These found their way into the interior of Sumatra where they came to be valued as a form of currency which could be accumulated as wealth. These cloths eventually became heirlooms and were used in social rituals such as wedding exchanges. While the practice of storing these textiles as wealth was eventually abandoned by the more cosmopolitan trading centres of the coast, the people of Lampung carefully stored their early trade textiles until the 1970s and 1980s, when they began to re-emerge in the antiques market.\nLarge skirt cloth (kain dodot): floral lattice Coromandel Coast, late 18th century, 230x309cm, Cotton; drawn and painted, resist and mordant dyed.\nIn the 17th century, the European East India Companies began shipping Indian cloth home along with cargoes of spices and Chinese porcelain. The cloth quickly became a sensation. Compared to the drab woollens and linens the Europeans were used to, the Indian cloth’s beauty, quality and affordability made them hugely popular in Europe. European textile producers at first were unable to compete, which in turn threatened the livelihoods of tens of thousands of local textile workers. Even high taxes and import restrictions could not halt the flood of Indian cloth into Europe.\nBeginning from the 18th century, innovators in Europe began to seek out the secrets of Indian textile production and started to develop ways to manufacture cloth more cheaply and efficiently. Mechanical innovations provided the key. Over the course of the century, new machines led to an explosion in productivity, which helped spark the Industrial Revolution.\nBy the mid-19th century, Europe was exporting more cloth to India than it imported. This cloth was cheaper and of better overall quality. European producers also captured much of India’s market share in other Asian and African markets. This had a disastrous impact on India’s textile industry, wiping out almost all of India’s indigenous textile production.\nIndian trade textiles had a lasting influence on the development of textile designs. While the new machine-made cloths were less expensive and more consistent in quality, they continued to draw on the design legacy of their Indian predecessors. The bright floral prints and dense styles of the 19th and early-20th centuries were direct descendants of Indian chintzes traded to Europe hundreds of years before.\nNowhere else perhaps is the influence of Indian trade textiles more noticeable than in island Southeast Asia, where many of the indigenous textile traditions were profoundly shaped by their long and nearly continuous interaction with Indian cloth. Indigenous communities around the archipelago actively incorporated the designs and motifs of Indian cloths into their own textiles. As the 18th century progressed and Indian textiles became more expensive, textiles made in Indonesia began to replace Indian cloths. Inexpensive and high quality machine-made plain white cotton from the Netherlands provided the raw materials for a boom in batik production in Java, which the Dutch colonial government actively encouraged.\nEven today’s fashion has continued to draw on the legacy of popular Indian designs. Once familiar with the designs, you will begin to spot them everywhere, such as in the repeating floral spray of a printed dress and in the scrolling border of a hemline. Indian trade textiles have left an indelible mark on the way we dress ourselves and decorate our homes. Perhaps even more profoundly, Indian trade textiles are a reminder that the globalised world we live in today has roots that go back thousands of years.\nDavid Alan Henkel is Curator, Asian Civilisations Museum", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/cotton-commodity-how-indian-textiles-shaped-history/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/cotton-commodity-how-indian-textiles-shaped-history/cotton-commodity-how-indian-textiles-shaped-history-1.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:41"},

Text by Clement Onn\nMuseSG Volume 5 Issue 3 – Jul to Sep 2012\nTreasure of the Aga Khan Museum: Architecture in Islamic Arts explored concepts of architecture and decoration in Islamic cultures through marvellous paintings, metalwork, ceramics and architectural elements. Itto offer insights into Islamic civilisations and their art and, in the process, foster knowledge and better understanding between Islamic societies and other cultures. The exhibition featured over a hundred works of art from various periods in the Islamic world spanning across Iran, India, Turkey, Syria, Spain, Egypt and China. All works of art were drawn from the collection of the Aga Khan Museum, which opened in 2014 in Toronto, Canada. Leading to the opening of the new museum, this exhibition travelled to three venues: the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg; the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur; and the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM).\nAt the ACM, the exhibition was divided into five sections that explored different concepts of space in religious and secular environments. Fortress and the City encompassed forts and fortified towns; Sacred Topographies used drawings and certificates to explore sites and monuments of Islamic pilgrimage; Religious and Funerary Architecture examined the importance of mosques and shrines; The Palace looked at the residences and lifestyles of royal courts; and, finally, Gardens, Pavilions and Tents discussed the importance of outdoor aesthetics and being close to nature.\nDr Pedro Moura Carvalho, Chief Curator at the ACM and lead curator of this exhibition, restructured the exhibition from its arrangement at the previous venues to put greater emphasis on these five themes. The exhibition gave visitors an opportunity to learn more about Islamic manuscript paintings, in particular, and to understand more of the diverse Islamic artistic traditions. Visitors who saw the exhibition at the previous venues would have been delighted to find the same works of art reinterpreted in Singapore.\nMoses regrets his Generosity towards the Intemperate Man\nFolio 93v from a manuscript of the Kulliyãt (collected works) of Sa dí\nMughal India, about 1604\nWatercolour, ink and gold on paper\n© Aga Khan Trust for Culture.\nMoses regrets his Generosity towards the Intemperate Man\nFolio 93v from a manuscript of the Kulliyãt (collected works) of Sa dí\nMughal India, about 1604\nWatercolour, ink and gold on paper\n© Aga Khan Trust for Culture.\nShah Ramin and his companions before the city of Darul-Bekam\nFrom a manuscript of the Tuhfet ul-leta if (Curious and Witty Gifts) by Ali ibn Naqib Hamza\nOttoman Turkey, dated 1002 AH / 1593–94\nWatercolour, ink, gold and silver on paper, 35.1x21cm\n© Aga Khan Trust for Culture.\nFortress and The City\nThe exhibition began by looking at the concept of fortified towns and medieval landscape development through paintings and various architectural elements. Images of forts, towns, enclosures, citadels and shrines are represented in the painting traditions of Ottoman Turkey (1299 - 1923), Safavid Iran (1501 - 1722) and Mughal India (1526 - 1858). Towns and palaces protected by tall walls and majestic gates often appear on the horizon in paintings. The scenes tend to be shown from a bird’s-eye view, which enabled the painter to depict a large fortress in the limited space of a painting. Very often they were created from the imagination of the painter rather than from direct observation. These imagined fortified structures enhance the grandeur and awe of fabled towns and emphasise the city’s impenetrability against hostile forces. Other paintings on display show urban landscapes depicting people, markets, houses, mosques and shrines inside towns.\nPlans of Medina and Mecca\nFrom a manuscript of the Dala’il al-khayrat (Guidelines to Blessings) by Muhammad ibn Sulayman-al-Jazuli\nProbably Ottoman Turkey, dated Muharram 1233 AH / November 1818\nWatercolour, ink and gold on paper; lacquered and gilt leather binding, pages 13.7 x 8.5 cm\n© Aga Khan Trust for Culture.\nHajj scroll (detail)\nHijaz or possibly India, dated 1202 AH / 1787–88\nWatercolour, ink and gold on paper, 918 x 45.5 cm\n© Aga Khan Trust for Culture.\nSacred Topographies\nThe Kaaba in the Masjid al-Haram (sacred enclosure) at Mecca stands at the heart of Islam. It provides the focus for the orientation of prayer and for the hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca that is a duty of every Muslim, provided they have the means and good health to do so. Other major pilgrimage sites include the Mosque of the Prophet at Medina, and the shrine of the Imam Reza in Mashhad, Iran. Representations of the Kaaba and other pilgrimage sites in manuscripts, manuals and certificates, and on ceramics were made as keepsakes for pilgrims and, in some cases, for verification purposes. In this section of the exhibition, the works of art are displayed in a stunning cubic structure which is five metres tall by five metres wide. This cube offers an intimate and serene space to view objects related to the hajj. Just as the Kaaba at Mecca stands at the heart of Islam, the cube aims to invoke a sense of the sacred topography and stands at the very centre of the exhibition gallery.\nPrince hears a sermon in a mosque\n\nFrom an illustrated manuscript of the Nigaristan (anecdotes on early Muslim figures) by Ahmad ibn Muhammad Ghaffari\nSafavid Iran, Shiraz, dated 980 AH / 1573\nWatercolour, ink and gold on paper, 38.4 x 23.7 cm\n© Aga Khan Trust for Culture.\nImam Ali slays Murra ibn Qays (detail)\nFolio from a dispersed manuscript of the Fãlnãma (Book of Divinations)\nIran, Qazwin, mid 1550s or early 1560s\nWatercolour, ink and gold on paper\n© Aga Khan Trust for Culture.\nReligious and Funerary Architecture\nThe practice of Islam does not require specific buildings for worship or to commemorate the dead. As long as they orient themselves towards Mecca, Muslims may pray in their own home or outdoors. Nevertheless, people have always turned to architecture to monumentalise their faith and to commemorate their dead. As a result, mosques, tombs and shrines represent some of the greatest monuments built in Islamic lands. The mosque is a space for ritual prayer and stands at the heart of Muslim religious life, while tombs and shrines became the focus of pious visitation. Works of art in this section highlight the rich adornment of such architectures through paintings, textiles, ceramics and carved wooden beams, many of which are inscribed with Qur’anic verses, as well as complex floral and geometric patterns.\nTile with male figures\nIran, possibly Kashan, late 13th or early 14th century\nGlazed fritware\n© Aga Khan Trust for Culture.\nEntertainment in a palace\nMughal India, Faizabad, about 1765 to 1770\nWatercolour and gold on paper, 50.2 x 69 cm\n© Aga Khan Trust for Culture.\nThe Palace\nThe grand appearance of palaces, both inside and out, was intended to magnify the aura of kingship and create awe in visitors and residents alike. These magnificent structures often exhibit the artistic and architectural creativity of local traditions. In paintings, palace scenes tend to depict the courtly pleasures of feasting, hospitality, performing arts and music in richly ornamented interiors. Decorative ceramics, painted stucco, textiles, along with carved stone and wood can be seen in painted representations of palace life, which suggests a luxurious taste for aesthetic beauty.\nSalm and Tur receive the reply of Faridun and Manuchihr\nFrom the Shahnama of Firdawsi Safavid Iran, Tabriz, about 1530\nWatercolour, ink, gold and silver on paper, 47.1 x 32 cm\n© Aga Khan Trust for Culture.\nStill life in a palace\nQajar Iran, first half of the 19th century\nOil on canvas, 152.5 x 134 cm\n© Aga Khan Trust for Culture.\nGardens, Pavilions, and Tents\nGardens are often referred to as an earthly version of the paradise promised in the Qur’an. Surah al-Rahman (Qur’an 55, on “The Merciful”) mentions a paradise that includes gardens, pavilions, carpets, flowing springs, evergreen trees and fruits. Many early Muslim rulers hailed from arid lands, such as the desert of Arabia, North Africa and parts of Iran and central Asia. Perhaps because of this barren heritage, they developed a keen interest in garden cultivation, water irrigation and appreciation of nature. Permanent and temporary structures like outdoor pavilions and tents were used to bring people and their affairs into closer proximity with nature. The use of tents and carpets not only enhanced the beauty of the natural environment, they were essential for dynasties such as the Timurids, for whom they were reminders of their nomadic past. As a result, courtly audiences and ceremonies in pavilions and tents are commonly depicted in manuscript paintings from the 15th century onwards.\nAmong the highlights of the exhibition are pages from the Shahnama, the epic historical poem written by the Persian poet Firdawsi in the late 10th century, and reproduced in marvellous illustrated editions. A folio produced for the Safavid king, Shah Tahmasp (1514 - 1576), is one of the most celebrated works in the Islamic world; pages from it are on display, along with other manuscript paintings and folios. There is a rare 18th-century hajj certificate with an inscription that includes the name of the surrogated pilgrim and the requestor. Architectural elements are also featured, such as a muqarnas from late 15th or 16th century Spain, ornamental doors from 15th-century Timurid Iran and 16th-century Iznik tiles from Turkey. Other works of art – in ceramic, metal, stone, wood, and painted or drawn on parchment and paper – present an overview of the artistic accomplishments of Islamic civilisations from the Iberian Peninsula to China.\nHis Highness The Aga Khan and The Aga Khan Development Network\nHis Highness the Aga Khan, founder and chairman of the Aga Khan Development Network, is the 49th hereditary Imam of the Shia Ismaili Muslims as of 2012. In the context of his hereditary responsibilities, His Highness the Aga Khan has been deeply engaged with development and education in Asia and Africa for more than 50 years.\nThe Aga Khan Development Network is a group of private, non-denominational agencies working to improve the quality of life for people in many parts of the developing world.\nThis exhibition was held in collaboration with the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, one of the agencies in the Development Network. The Aga Khan Trust for Culture focuses on culture as a means of enhancing the physical, social and economic revitalisation of communities in the Islamic world. Some of its programmes include the Aga Khan Award for Architecture, the Aga Khan Historic Cities Programme, the Music Initiative in Central Asia and the upcoming project – the Aga Khan Museum in Toronto.\nThe Aga Khan Museum, Toronto\nOpened in 2014, the Aga Khan Museum houses the art and objects assembled by His Highness the Aga Khan and his family, comprising some of the most important works of Islamic art in the world. The museum is dedicated to the collection, research, preservation and display of objects of artistic, cultural and historical significance from various periods and geographic areas in the Muslim world.\nClement Onn is Curator, Cross Culture, Asian Civilisations Museum.\nDarul Aman Mosque.

Cotton; block printed, drawn and painted, resist and mordant dyed.\nEvidence from excavations in the Indus Valley dating back to about 4,500 years ago shows that Indians had already developed the technology to weave cotton into cloth at that time. Two thousand years ago, Indian artisans and traders had built on their knowledge, along with a parallel expertise in painting and dyeing cloth, to become the world’s leader in textile production. They had held this position until the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century.\nIndia’s advantage in textile production not only stemmed from its technological edge. The Indian subcontinent had a large population, which provided the workforce to perform the labour-intensive job of producing textiles. India also had ample land and a distinct dry season that made the region an ideal place to grow cotton. These advantages allowed Indian producers to manufacture a large surplus of cloth which it could trade to foreign markets.\nTextile production and major trade centres in the Indian subcontinent, 1600-1900.\nThe bulk of India’s textiles were cotton of modest quality – plain colours or simple, repetitive patterns of checks, stripes or floral lattices. These textiles were sold in foreign marketplaces more cheaply than cloth could be produced locally. At the other end of the market, India’s weavers and dyers were capable of producing cotton and silk textiles of exquisite quality and beauty.\nThe Indian textile industry was both productive and efficient. First, weavers living in or near cotton growing areas would process and weave the cotton into cloth. Next, the cloth would be graded; following which middlemen would purchase the cloth and send it to workshops for dyeing, printing and painting. Dyers had to be located near adequate sources of clean water to ensure the quality of the bright and colourfast dyes which India was famous for. After dyeing, the agents would sell the cloth to merchants heading to foreign ports. India’s traders had developed a sophisticated understanding of the markets they served, providing feedback to producers on the types and qualities of cloth that were most in demand. These merchants, often settled and had families in their host markets, knew the tastes of their customers and were able to relay information to the agents about what colours, designs, formats and levels of quality were most desirable. At the height of the Indian textile trade, merchants even brought back local designs and motifs which the painters and dyers faithfully copied.\nHanging (kain leluhur): large flowers and cartouches Coromandel Coast, 18th century. 171 x 277cm, Cotton; drawn and painted, resist and mordant dyed.\nThe earliest evidence we have on foreign trade of Indian textiles is in the Roman account of the first century. The Romans called Indian cotton “woven air”, in praise of its lightness and quality. These accounts described Indian cloth as a luxury good; however, the quantities were sufficient for Pliny the Elder to complain in 77 CE (Common Era) that Roman coffers were being emptied into India. Historical records from about the same period also mention Indian cotton being sent as gifts to the Emperor of China. The oldest examples of Indian cloth are fragments found at archaeological sites in Egypt, along the coast of the Red Sea at Berenike (old Bernice), and date to the fifth century. More fragments, which date from the ninth century, were excavated at Quesir Al Qadim and Fustat (Old Cairo).\nThe fragments found in Egypt are proof that trade in Indian cloth continued to flow even after Rome’s gradual decline. The Islamic world also embraced Indian textiles after its rise in the seventh century, and the new religion spread to both South and Southeast Asia along the same routes on which Indian textiles were traded. By the end of the 15th century, this robust and complex network had spread throughout the Indian Ocean basin and from the western coast of Africa to China.\nWhen the Portuguese captured Malacca in 1511, the Portuguese chronicler Tomé Pires estimated that the annual value of Malacca’s textile trade was worth 460,000 cruzados, the equivalent of almost 20 tonnes of silver. At that time, Malacca was one of the world’s richest cities, and Southeast Asia had grown to be a crucial market for Indian trade cloth. Island Southeast Asia was also the source of some of the world’s rarest and most desirable spices and aromatics, as well as other valuable commodities. Aside from the fragments found in Egypt, the earliest Indian trade textiles which survive today were found in the eastern half of the Indonesian Archipelago. These came from the remote islands of Maluku, as well as Timor and especially from the Toraja Highlands of Sulawesi. Some of these textiles have radiocarbon dates which range into the late 13th century.\nMaluku, a tiny cluster of islands in the far Eastern Archipelago, was for much of history the world’s only source of nutmeg, mace and cloves. These so-called “fine spices” were used to preserve and flavour food as well as for their perceived medicinal powers. For centuries, these spices were literally worth their weight in gold in the West. Not surprisingly, traders flocked to the islands, bringing with them Indian cloth which were highly prized by the islanders.\nWhile Maluku was more important economically during the time of the spice trade, it is Toraja which is the source of most of the earliest trade textiles that have been found. The Toraja called these textiles ma’a or mawa and believed that they served as a sacred bridge to the afterlife. Ma’a were used in funerals and other rituals and allowed the Toraja to interact and communicate with their ancestors. After the Dutch took control of the coastal ports of Sulawesi, the Toraja became isolated from the outside world and could no longer replace their Indian cloth. Instead they had to carefully preserve these textiles for generations, whereas in most other areas the cloths eventually disintegrated, were lost or replaced.\nEarly inscriptions found at archaeological sites clearly indicate that Indian cloth had been traded into Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, Borneo and Java in as early as the ninth century. The earliest and finest pieces discovered in this area, however, date from the 17th and 18th centuries. These were found in the remote interior areas of kampung and Jambi in southern Sumatra, and almost all originated from the Coromandel Coast.\nSkirt cloth (kain leluhur): patchwork centerfield Coromandel Coast, 17th or 18th century, 223x422cm, Cotton; drawn and painted, resist and mordant dyed.\nThe reasons for this are complex. For one, the pepper boom of the 17th century had significantly increased the flow of cloth into the region during this period. More importantly, large amounts of top quality cloth were brought in by traders as gifts to local rulers. These found their way into the interior of Sumatra where they came to be valued as a form of currency which could be accumulated as wealth. These cloths eventually became heirlooms and were used in social rituals such as wedding exchanges. While the practice of storing these textiles as wealth was eventually abandoned by the more cosmopolitan trading centres of the coast, the people of Lampung carefully stored their early trade textiles until the 1970s and 1980s, when they began to re-emerge in the antiques market.\nLarge skirt cloth (kain dodot): floral lattice Coromandel Coast, late 18th century, 230x309cm, Cotton; drawn and painted, resist and mordant dyed.\nIn the 17th century, the European East India Companies began shipping Indian cloth home along with cargoes of spices and Chinese porcelain. The cloth quickly became a sensation. Compared to the drab woollens and linens the Europeans were used to, the Indian cloth’s beauty, quality and affordability made them hugely popular in Europe. European textile producers at first were unable to compete, which in turn threatened the livelihoods of tens of thousands of local textile workers. Even high taxes and import restrictions could not halt the flood of Indian cloth into Europe.\nBeginning from the 18th century, innovators in Europe began to seek out the secrets of Indian textile production and started to develop ways to manufacture cloth more cheaply and efficiently. Mechanical innovations provided the key. Over the course of the century, new machines led to an explosion in productivity, which helped spark the Industrial Revolution.\nBy the mid-19th century, Europe was exporting more cloth to India than it imported. This cloth was cheaper and of better overall quality. European producers also captured much of India’s market share in other Asian and African markets. This had a disastrous impact on India’s textile industry, wiping out almost all of India’s indigenous textile production.\nIndian trade textiles had a lasting influence on the development of textile designs. While the new machine-made cloths were less expensive and more consistent in quality, they continued to draw on the design legacy of their Indian predecessors. The bright floral prints and dense styles of the 19th and early-20th centuries were direct descendants of Indian chintzes traded to Europe hundreds of years before.\nNowhere else perhaps is the influence of Indian trade textiles more noticeable than in island Southeast Asia, where many of the indigenous textile traditions were profoundly shaped by their long and nearly continuous interaction with Indian cloth. Indigenous communities around the archipelago actively incorporated the designs and motifs of Indian cloths into their own textiles. As the 18th century progressed and Indian textiles became more expensive, textiles made in Indonesia began to replace Indian cloths. Inexpensive and high quality machine-made plain white cotton from the Netherlands provided the raw materials for a boom in batik production in Java, which the Dutch colonial government actively encouraged.\nEven today’s fashion has continued to draw on the legacy of popular Indian designs. Once familiar with the designs, you will begin to spot them everywhere, such as in the repeating floral spray of a printed dress and in the scrolling border of a hemline. Indian trade textiles have left an indelible mark on the way we dress ourselves and decorate our homes. Perhaps even more profoundly, Indian trade textiles are a reminder that the globalised world we live in today has roots that go back thousands of years.\nDavid Alan Henkel is Curator, Asian Civilisations Museum", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/cotton-commodity-how-indian-textiles-shaped-history/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/cotton-commodity-how-indian-textiles-shaped-history/cotton-commodity-how-indian-textiles-shaped-history-1.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:42"},

Text by Clement Onn\nMuseSG Volume 5 Issue 3 – Jul to Sep 2012\nTreasure of the Aga Khan Museum: Architecture in Islamic Arts explored concepts of architecture and decoration in Islamic cultures through marvellous paintings, metalwork, ceramics and architectural elements. Itto offer insights into Islamic civilisations and their art and, in the process, foster knowledge and better understanding between Islamic societies and other cultures. The exhibition featured over a hundred works of art from various periods in the Islamic world spanning across Iran, India, Turkey, Syria, Spain, Egypt and China. All works of art were drawn from the collection of the Aga Khan Museum, which opened in 2014 in Toronto, Canada. Leading to the opening of the new museum, this exhibition travelled to three venues: the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg; the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur; and the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM).\nAt the ACM, the exhibition was divided into five sections that explored different concepts of space in religious and secular environments. Fortress and the City encompassed forts and fortified towns; Sacred Topographies used drawings and certificates to explore sites and monuments of Islamic pilgrimage; Religious and Funerary Architecture examined the importance of mosques and shrines; The Palace looked at the residences and lifestyles of royal courts; and, finally, Gardens, Pavilions and Tents discussed the importance of outdoor aesthetics and being close to nature.\nDr Pedro Moura Carvalho, Chief Curator at the ACM and lead curator of this exhibition, restructured the exhibition from its arrangement at the previous venues to put greater emphasis on these five themes. The exhibition gave visitors an opportunity to learn more about Islamic manuscript paintings, in particular, and to understand more of the diverse Islamic artistic traditions. Visitors who saw the exhibition at the previous venues would have been delighted to find the same works of art reinterpreted in Singapore.\nMoses regrets his Generosity towards the Intemperate Man\nFolio 93v from a manuscript of the Kulliyãt (collected works) of Sa dí\nMughal India, about 1604\nWatercolour, ink and gold on paper\n© Aga Khan Trust for Culture.\nMoses regrets his Generosity towards the Intemperate Man\nFolio 93v from a manuscript of the Kulliyãt (collected works) of Sa dí\nMughal India, about 1604\nWatercolour, ink and gold on paper\n© Aga Khan Trust for Culture.\nShah Ramin and his companions before the city of Darul-Bekam\nFrom a manuscript of the Tuhfet ul-leta if (Curious and Witty Gifts) by Ali ibn Naqib Hamza\nOttoman Turkey, dated 1002 AH / 1593–94\nWatercolour, ink, gold and silver on paper, 35.1x21cm\n© Aga Khan Trust for Culture.\nFortress and The City\nThe exhibition began by looking at the concept of fortified towns and medieval landscape development through paintings and various architectural elements. Images of forts, towns, enclosures, citadels and shrines are represented in the painting traditions of Ottoman Turkey (1299 - 1923), Safavid Iran (1501 - 1722) and Mughal India (1526 - 1858). Towns and palaces protected by tall walls and majestic gates often appear on the horizon in paintings. The scenes tend to be shown from a bird’s-eye view, which enabled the painter to depict a large fortress in the limited space of a painting. Very often they were created from the imagination of the painter rather than from direct observation. These imagined fortified structures enhance the grandeur and awe of fabled towns and emphasise the city’s impenetrability against hostile forces. Other paintings on display show urban landscapes depicting people, markets, houses, mosques and shrines inside towns.\nPlans of Medina and Mecca\nFrom a manuscript of the Dala’il al-khayrat (Guidelines to Blessings) by Muhammad ibn Sulayman-al-Jazuli\nProbably Ottoman Turkey, dated Muharram 1233 AH / November 1818\nWatercolour, ink and gold on paper; lacquered and gilt leather binding, pages 13.7 x 8.5 cm\n© Aga Khan Trust for Culture.\nHajj scroll (detail)\nHijaz or possibly India, dated 1202 AH / 1787–88\nWatercolour, ink and gold on paper, 918 x 45.5 cm\n© Aga Khan Trust for Culture.\nSacred Topographies\nThe Kaaba in the Masjid al-Haram (sacred enclosure) at Mecca stands at the heart of Islam. It provides the focus for the orientation of prayer and for the hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca that is a duty of every Muslim, provided they have the means and good health to do so. Other major pilgrimage sites include the Mosque of the Prophet at Medina, and the shrine of the Imam Reza in Mashhad, Iran. Representations of the Kaaba and other pilgrimage sites in manuscripts, manuals and certificates, and on ceramics were made as keepsakes for pilgrims and, in some cases, for verification purposes. In this section of the exhibition, the works of art are displayed in a stunning cubic structure which is five metres tall by five metres wide. This cube offers an intimate and serene space to view objects related to the hajj. Just as the Kaaba at Mecca stands at the heart of Islam, the cube aims to invoke a sense of the sacred topography and stands at the very centre of the exhibition gallery.\nPrince hears a sermon in a mosque\n\nFrom an illustrated manuscript of the Nigaristan (anecdotes on early Muslim figures) by Ahmad ibn Muhammad Ghaffari\nSafavid Iran, Shiraz, dated 980 AH / 1573\nWatercolour, ink and gold on paper, 38.4 x 23.7 cm\n© Aga Khan Trust for Culture.\nImam Ali slays Murra ibn Qays (detail)\nFolio from a dispersed manuscript of the Fãlnãma (Book of Divinations)\nIran, Qazwin, mid 1550s or early 1560s\nWatercolour, ink and gold on paper\n© Aga Khan Trust for Culture.\nReligious and Funerary Architecture\nThe practice of Islam does not require specific buildings for worship or to commemorate the dead. As long as they orient themselves towards Mecca, Muslims may pray in their own home or outdoors. Nevertheless, people have always turned to architecture to monumentalise their faith and to commemorate their dead. As a result, mosques, tombs and shrines represent some of the greatest monuments built in Islamic lands. The mosque is a space for ritual prayer and stands at the heart of Muslim religious life, while tombs and shrines became the focus of pious visitation. Works of art in this section highlight the rich adornment of such architectures through paintings, textiles, ceramics and carved wooden beams, many of which are inscribed with Qur’anic verses, as well as complex floral and geometric patterns.\nTile with male figures\nIran, possibly Kashan, late 13th or early 14th century\nGlazed fritware\n© Aga Khan Trust for Culture.\nEntertainment in a palace\nMughal India, Faizabad, about 1765 to 1770\nWatercolour and gold on paper, 50.2 x 69 cm\n© Aga Khan Trust for Culture.\nThe Palace\nThe grand appearance of palaces, both inside and out, was intended to magnify the aura of kingship and create awe in visitors and residents alike. These magnificent structures often exhibit the artistic and architectural creativity of local traditions. In paintings, palace scenes tend to depict the courtly pleasures of feasting, hospitality, performing arts and music in richly ornamented interiors. Decorative ceramics, painted stucco, textiles, along with carved stone and wood can be seen in painted representations of palace life, which suggests a luxurious taste for aesthetic beauty.\nSalm and Tur receive the reply of Faridun and Manuchihr\nFrom the Shahnama of Firdawsi Safavid Iran, Tabriz, about 1530\nWatercolour, ink, gold and silver on paper, 47.1 x 32 cm\n© Aga Khan Trust for Culture.\nStill life in a palace\nQajar Iran, first half of the 19th century\nOil on canvas, 152.5 x 134 cm\n© Aga Khan Trust for Culture.\nGardens, Pavilions, and Tents\nGardens are often referred to as an earthly version of the paradise promised in the Qur’an. Surah al-Rahman (Qur’an 55, on “The Merciful”) mentions a paradise that includes gardens, pavilions, carpets, flowing springs, evergreen trees and fruits. Many early Muslim rulers hailed from arid lands, such as the desert of Arabia, North Africa and parts of Iran and central Asia. Perhaps because of this barren heritage, they developed a keen interest in garden cultivation, water irrigation and appreciation of nature. Permanent and temporary structures like outdoor pavilions and tents were used to bring people and their affairs into closer proximity with nature. The use of tents and carpets not only enhanced the beauty of the natural environment, they were essential for dynasties such as the Timurids, for whom they were reminders of their nomadic past. As a result, courtly audiences and ceremonies in pavilions and tents are commonly depicted in manuscript paintings from the 15th century onwards.\nAmong the highlights of the exhibition are pages from the Shahnama, the epic historical poem written by the Persian poet Firdawsi in the late 10th century, and reproduced in marvellous illustrated editions. A folio produced for the Safavid king, Shah Tahmasp (1514 - 1576), is one of the most celebrated works in the Islamic world; pages from it are on display, along with other manuscript paintings and folios. There is a rare 18th-century hajj certificate with an inscription that includes the name of the surrogated pilgrim and the requestor. Architectural elements are also featured, such as a muqarnas from late 15th or 16th century Spain, ornamental doors from 15th-century Timurid Iran and 16th-century Iznik tiles from Turkey. Other works of art – in ceramic, metal, stone, wood, and painted or drawn on parchment and paper – present an overview of the artistic accomplishments of Islamic civilisations from the Iberian Peninsula to China.\nHis Highness The Aga Khan and The Aga Khan Development Network\nHis Highness the Aga Khan, founder and chairman of the Aga Khan Development Network, is the 49th hereditary Imam of the Shia Ismaili Muslims as of 2012. In the context of his hereditary responsibilities, His Highness the Aga Khan has been deeply engaged with development and education in Asia and Africa for more than 50 years.\nThe Aga Khan Development Network is a group of private, non-denominational agencies working to improve the quality of life for people in many parts of the developing world.\nThis exhibition was held in collaboration with the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, one of the agencies in the Development Network. The Aga Khan Trust for Culture focuses on culture as a means of enhancing the physical, social and economic revitalisation of communities in the Islamic world. Some of its programmes include the Aga Khan Award for Architecture, the Aga Khan Historic Cities Programme, the Music Initiative in Central Asia and the upcoming project – the Aga Khan Museum in Toronto.\nThe Aga Khan Museum, Toronto\nOpened in 2014, the Aga Khan Museum houses the art and objects assembled by His Highness the Aga Khan and his family, comprising some of the most important works of Islamic art in the world. The museum is dedicated to the collection, research, preservation and display of objects of artistic, cultural and historical significance from various periods and geographic areas in the Muslim world.\nClement Onn is Curator, Cross Culture, Asian Civilisations Museum.\nDarul Aman Mosque.

It was built on land donated by influential businessman and devout Buddhist Low Kim Pong; today, the monastery is nestled amidst high-rise public housing flats in Toa Payoh. \nThere are three main buildings in the monastery. The main prayer hall, known as the Mahavira Hall (or Daxiong Baodian), was constructed in 1904, while the entrance hall, called the Tian Wang Dian, was built the following year. These two structures were gazetted collectively as a national monument. In 1903, the Dharma Hall was completed; however, this was rebuilt in the 1970s due to structural deterioration. Decades later, the Dharma Hall was again rebuilt according to its original architectural style from 1903, and this new structure was completed in 2016.\nThe Mahavira Hall, 1950s. The upper tier of the roof is constructed in the Fuzhou style, featuring a steeper angle at the corners, while the lower tier is built in the Quanzhou style, with a gentler angle.\nModelled after the historic Xichan Temple in Fuzhou, China, the monastery follows the traditional conglin layout in which the various structures are symmetrical in plan, separated by courtyards and usually face the north-south direction with the entrance facing the south, according to fengshui principles. The conglin layout is meant to instil monastic discipline. \nThe overall architecture adopts a traditional Hokkien style, with a blend of Fuzhou, Quanzhou and Zhangzhou characteristics apparent across the various structures in the complex. For instance, the sharply curved corners on the roof are typical of the Fuzhou style, while the other buildings have bigger, heavier roofs with corners that curve at a gentler angle, which are distinctive Quanzhou features. These two architectural styles are seen in the double-tier roof of the Mahavira Hall: the upper-tier is of the Fuzhou idiom, while the lower-tier is Quanzhou style. The Zhangzhou style can be glimpsed in the roof of the Tian Wang Dian. It is very similar to its Quanzhou counterpart; the only difference is that the roof of the former has a steeper slope and a more complex roof truss.\nBuilt in 1905, the entrance hall, Tian Wang Dian, is one of the three main buildings in the monastery.\nFrom the 1990s up to the 2000s, the monastery carried out a series of restoration works to repair much of its structures which had fallen into disrepair. Significantly, the Bell and Drum Towers, which had been rebuilt in the 1970s, suffered from spalling concrete and had to be demolished and reconstructed. The temple committee consulted traditional architecture experts, and extensive research was conducted to recreate the towers, using photographs from the 1900s as a reference. \nModern technology and materials were employed to ensure that the finer architectural details specific to the Fuzhou style, such as the elegant upswing of the roof eaves, would be rendered in a way that could withstand the test of time. Wall motifs that had originally been made of clay and mortar were recreated on granite for a longer lifespan. For the same reason, Chengal timber, which is more termite-resistant, was chosen instead of the original Chinese fir.\nWooden joinery as part of the reconstruction of the Drum and Bell Tower. This is an ancient technique for temple construction.\nCompleted section of wooden joinery, with the locking pieces all in place.\nIn the mid-2000s, the monastery experienced water leakage in its roof. The roof tiles had been laid 20 years ago using the traditional wet-lay method whereby a mortar bed held the tiles on the pitched roof. However, this method was not appropriate for Singapore’s tropical climate—hairline cracks formed on the mortar and roof tiles over time, leading to water leakage. In planning for the reconstruction of the Dharma Hall in 2008, the monastery consulted their Buddhist architectural adviser from Hong Kong, the Venerable Wang Fun, who advised adopting the dry-lay method for the roof tile installation, while a Japanese roof tile manufacturer was also roped in to provide details on the installation.\nDemonstration of the dry-lay method. As can be seen, there is no roof cement screed and plasterwork; instead, the tiles are laid in an interlocking pattern on the new lightweight aluminium roof battens.\nEventually, the supporting frame for the tiles was secured on the timber frame underneath with fasteners, and all timber structures beneath were protected by a water-tight roof. The dry-lay method was employed to replace the roof tiles for the Dharma Hall, spanning some 7,000 m2, and it has proven to achieve a very high degree of watertightness.\nThe Dharma Hall today is a reconstruction of the original architecture from 1903. The building was officially opened in 2016.\nAfter more than two decades of restoration to its weathered structures, the Lian Shan Shuang Lin Monastery today proudly presents a fresh face to visitors from all over the world.\nAbout The Preservation of Sites and Monuments\nThe Preservation of Sites and Monuments (PSM) is a division under the National Heritage Board. Its primary role is to safeguard Singapore’s built heritage by identifying monuments that are of “historic, cultural, traditional, archaeological, architectural, artistic or symbolic significance and national importance”, and recommending them to the state for preservation.

A year later, she was appointed co-head, and her responsibilities included training new docents. When Rosalind Tan was growing up, her mother would speak to her and the rest of the family, only in Malay. Baba Malay to be exact.\nThis baffled her. She looked Chinese, had Chinese ancestry but did not have a Chinese name.That simple act fuelled an interest in her origins.\nRosalind is Peranakan Chinese. “I come from an ethnic culture that not many people know about. Most people take it that you're half Malay and half Chinese, period. That's the most that they know,” she says.\nShe would learn that her ancestors, who were from China, arrived in the Straits of Malacca in the 19th century and married local women.\nReligion was not on the forefront of these women's minds. They were more concerned about basic needs such as food, shelter and clothing — so they took on the religion of their husbands. As a result, Peranakan Chinese are not Muslims, and pork is a regular feature in their cuisine.\nHer roots were very much alive at home. Rosalind 's mother came from Malacca, had Hokkien roots but spoke only Baba Malay, while her father was ethnically Chinese. His first wife only bore him two daughters after twelve years of marriage. Because sons were valued in Peranakan culture, he decided to take on a second wife.\n“'My father was an Anglophile - the “King’s Chinese” as they were referred to then. His children would take the names of English kings and queens. My mother bore him eight sons and six daughters.” adds Rosalind. “Going by her lineage, I am fifth-generation Peranakan. My children are sixth and my grandchildren are seventh.”\nStarting early\nHer passion for volunteering began in secondary school. Rosalind started a social service club, which regularly visited childrens’ and nursing homes.\nShe later fundraised for the National Council of Social Service and was awarded the Special Volunteer Award. She has also been an air stewardess, worked in hotel management and real estate.\nRosalind retired at age 55. At that point, volunteering seemed like a natural next step. The Peranakan Museum had opened that year, just as she was entertaining the idea of becoming a docent.\nA visit to the museum sealed the deal. On display was an artefact: a Catholic altar with carvings of the phoenix and qilins.\n“I nearly fainted. I saw an artefact that once belonged to my family. I recognised it because I had seen it from afar, from the main door (of the home of my father's first wife),” she recalls. “I couldn't believe it so I brought some family members there. And, they said yes, it's the one.”\nLooking back, she reflects, “I believed that I could add value to the museum. Plus, I was looking to contribute to society in the space of arts and culture, and better still, in the promotion of an ethnic culture which even my own ethnic group don’t know much about.”\nRosalind started training to be a docent in 2009. A year later, she was appointed co-head, and her responsibilities included training new docents.\nReaching out\nIn 2010, Rosalind mooted the idea of tours for the elderly in Hokkien, Teochew and Cantonese dialects and the Malay language at The Peranakan Museum.\nAlthough there were requests for Mandarin tours at that time, she didn't speak the language, and wanted to present them with alternatives.\nThe tours were a hit. The museum would host a group of eight to ten seniors once every two months. As time went on, the tours were held twice a month.\nElderly visitors loved the mock-up of an old kitchen, which was on display at the museum, and often shared their own stories of earlier times. Those who lived on Pulau Ubin would share that they reared chicken and ducks for a living. To get running water, they needed to pay 50 cents for the installation of water pipes, said Rosalind.\nThen, the Alzheimer's Disease Association (ADA) wanted to take persons with dementia to the museum, as part of their therapy. Collaborating with The Peranakan Museum, ADA conducted a typographical survey in 2011, to ensure that it would be a safe environment. The route needed to be wheelchair-friendly and bright.\nRosalind also visited the association's New Horizon Centres with other docents. They found out more about its programmes for persons with dementia, which included arts and craft. They then decided that their museum tours for ADA’s clients would include the porcelain and kebaya galleries, to draw connections to familiar colours and patterns. Elderly visitors were also served tea with red dates before tours, to put them at ease.\n“We are not trained medical personnel, so we needed to be very sensitive to how they would react to a new place. I think being friendly, warm and approachable is very important,” Rosalind says.\nNew horizons\nADA tours have since expanded to the National Museum of Singapore, with the launching of “Memories Cafe” in 2018. Held on Saturdays for persons with dementia and their caregivers, they visit two galleries which touch on Singapore in the 1950s, after a meal at the “Food for Thought” cafe.\nThe 65-year-old especially enjoys giving private tours. She feels there is far too much to tell in a typical hour. “I'd like to think that I have added some value especially in disseminating information about this niche culture.”\n“To me, it is a great honour and privilege, and because of that, it's a tremendous duty. I must ensure I do the right thing, provide the right information and teach the children right, because oral traditions are not in the history books,” sums up Rosalind.\nBy Annabelle Liang", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/Rosalind-Tan-Heritage-Volunteer/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/nhb-volunteers-articles/rosalind-tan/rosalind-tan-022.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:42"},

Location\nBuildings and Sites sksks\n44 Hoot Kiam Road, Singapore 249421\nGet Directions\nThe Zion Full Gospel Church’s history began in September 1949, when Finnish missionaries arrived on Singapore’s shores after leaving China. While others journeyed on to other Asian countries, Sisters Nilja Nikkanen and Aira Kolkka remained in Singapore, becoming the first Finnish missionaries in the city. They practiced their evangelicalism by standing at street corners and playing their guitars or singing songs in Mandarin. The sisters’ presence attracted a number of people, some of whom would approach them and offer advice or assistance.\nEstablishing The Church\nThe sisters eventually began their meetings in an attap house along Grange Road, and later moved to the Indus Square Alexandra area. Throughout their mission, they were assisted by several passionate community members who offered their spare time to assist with the evangelical mission.\nZion Full Gospel Church was the first among several churches in Singapore that were established by the Finnish mission. In 1965, the church—with financial contributions from Finnish Christian emigrants—acquired its own building in Tanglin. It later became the first church in Singapore to host its worship services in a shopping centre, when it acquired two units of office space at Queensway Shopping Centre.\nMoving To A New Home\nIn 1980, the church moved to its current premises at Hoot Kiam Road. With the funds from the sale of the Queensway property, the church set out to restore its premises. The restoration was completed in March 1999, with funds to spare.\nThe church is identifiable by its striking art-deco architecture. This architectural style rose in popularity in Europe with the advent of aeroplanes and steam ships, where elements inspired by speed, such as elongations and lines, were used. This architectural style is evident in the church’s exterior façade. Rounded edge walls support a reinforced concrete flat roof and continuous concrete ledges. The walls display prominent composition of geometrical lines and shapes, with no classical ornamentation.\nEntering A New Era\nWith the appointment of Reverend Randy Sing as the church’s Senior Pastor in 2000, the church ushered in a new era as a missions-focused church.\nTwo outposts were established—one at a rented shophouse in Bukit Panjang and another at the Malaysian town of Kluang. Both outposts held services on Sunday evenings.\nIn 2004, Zion Full Gospel Church became the 49th church to be a part of the Assemblies of God movement in Singapore. It now runs three worship services weekly—in English, Mandarin and Hokkien.\nAt the time of writing, the church continues to strengthen its outreach with several new initiatives, such as street witnessing, a mass memorial service and a carnival event.\nBuildings and sites featured on Roots.SG are part of our efforts to raise awareness of our heritage; a listing on Roots.SG does not imply any form of preservation or conservation status, unless it is mentioned in the article.

Today, she is one of the most active and respected volunteer guides among the Mandarin Docents. When she was a young woman, Long Chin Peng had to quit her job as a Chinese teacher. Being a mother of four children, of whom two had special needs, meant she had to spend endless hours feeding them with special bottles, ferrying them to doctors, dentists and speech therapists, and worrying while they recovered from surgeries. She felt that there was absolutely no way she could balance that kind of stress with a full-time job.\nSoon enough, her kids grew older and more independent. They began urging her to get out of the house and pick up new hobbies. She still remembers their encouraging words: “Mummy, you should go and do something you like.”\nBy coincidence, the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) had just begun a recruitment drive for volunteer Mandarin guides. She found out about it from an advertisement in the LianheZaobao, while she was eating dim sum with friends at Chinatown’s Yum Cha Restaurant. All three of them signed up, but only she was called back for an interview.\nThat was back in 2003. Today, the 49-year-old Chin Peng is one of the most active and respected volunteer guides among the Mandarin Docents. She leads tours not only at the ACM, but also at the National Museum of Singapore, the Peranakan Museum, the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall, the Malay Heritage Centre, and the Indian Heritage Centre.\nThe Peranakan Museum is especially dear to her heart as her aunt is a Nyonya, and Chin Peng did her thesis at Peking University on Peranakan culture. As a member of the Museum Volunteers group at the Peranakan Museum, she guides visitors in Mandarin as well as in English.\nOn top of all this, Chin Peng also volunteers at institutions that are not operated by the National Heritage Board. These include the National Gallery, the Art Science Museum, the National Library, Nanyang Technological University’s Chinese Heritage Centre, the Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Associations, the Kong Chow Wui Koon, the Istana, and the newly-opened Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre. In short, she has gone from being a full-time mother to a full-time museum volunteer.\nPatriotic duty\nWhat drives Chin Peng to do so much of this work? In part, it is a sense of patriotic duty. “I try and contribute back to society,” she says. “I love my country. I love my country’s history, so I want to carry it onwards.” Whatever exhibition she is in, whether it is about the Silk Road or Southeast Asian artists, she takes care to explain how it relates to Singapore’s multicultural identity.\nHowever, she has also developed a special bond with the museum staff and volunteers. That makes her feel like they are part of her own family. “You walk into the museum and it’s like going back home. Sometimes, when we don’t have enough visitors, we just walk through and talk to the security staff. They take care of us very well.”\nOver the years, she has learned to tailor her tours to different audiences. When she is with kids in the Peranakan Museum, she takes them to the play area near the wedding galleries, or points out where they can stamp their tickets. When she is with elderly visitors, she asks them about their own heritage and their memories of the past.\nVIPs require special treatment. Because they are often on tight schedules, she often has to give them a 20-minute whirlwind tour of an exhibition’s star pieces. As she talks, she monitors their faces closely for signs of boredom, so she can lengthen or shorten her explanations accordingly.\nThe next generation\nRecently, Chin Peng has also been training kids to be Mandarin guides themselves. She does twelve-hour workshops with students, teaching them to create tours of the Peranakan Museum, Asian Civilisations Museum, and Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall.\nThis is difficult for many of them, especially when they have limited vocabulary. When they are asked to write about the artefacts, their descriptions are often full of English words, and hanyu pinyin (Romanised Chinese). But, with a little coaching, Chin Peng builds up their confidence and soon has them speaking fluently in their mother tongue. A few weeks later, their fellow students arrive on a field trip, and the kids are able to present a complete tour of the galleries to their friends.\nOn occasion, Chin Peng has even had family members join her as volunteers. In 2012, her son Lukas had finished his polytechnic studies, and was waiting to enlist for National Service. He and his cousin decided to help her out with the many activities that the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall had planned for its anniversary. While she led VIPs through the galleries, they worked as receptionists and picked up guests at the airport. This gave them a new sense of appreciation for all the work that goes into sustaining our heritage.\nThese days, Chin Peng finds that she is often involved in recruitment drives for new volunteers—something she never dreamt she would be doing when she first signed up 14 years ago. She is impressed by the calibre of the new docents, who are often highly educated professionals. Notably, many of them are new immigrants from China, with excellent Mandarin skills.\nHowever, what is most important to her is whether a volunteer is truly committed. “I will always ask them, ‘Do you have the passion? And, do you have the time?’ Because if you don’t, then it will be very hard,” she says. “You may have to make sacrifices. You have to really want this.”\nOf course, Chin Peng’s own commitment has never been in question. After years of devoting herself to the health and welfare of her family, she is free to share her knowledge about history—an act which truly brings her joy.\nBy Ng Yi-Sheng", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/heritage-volunteers-long-chin-peng/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/heritage-volunteers/01-long-chin-peng/long-chin-peng-1_ca8a9812.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:43"},
{"id": "9A9AE3AD-0864-4E1B-A1B9-A50A2F48FCBB", "title": "The Singapore Story through 60 objects", "dated": "unknown", "artist": "unknown", "role": "unknown", "department": "unknown", "medium": "unknown", "country": "china", "description": "Discover 60 objects from Singapore's various National Collections that provide a sweeping overview of the story of Singapore from the late first millennium, through the colonial period to the present. Author\nKennie Ting, Director, Asian Civilisations Museum and Peranakan Museum & Group Director of Museums, National Heritage Board\nPublication\nCultural Connections Volume IV 2019\nPublisher\nCulture Academy Singapore\nAs we reflect on the bicentennial of modern Singapore this year, we should not forget another significant milestone in our nation's history: Singapore's achievement of internal self-government in June 1959. This year marks its 60th anniversary.\nTo commemorate 60 years of self-rule, this graphic spread presents 60 objects from Singapore's various National Collections which, when taken together, provide a sweeping overview of the story of Singapore from the late first millennium, through the colonial period to the present.\nThe objects presented here are curated along five key sections:\nA) Networks through Time, B) Colonial, C) Community and Faith, D) Art Historical, and E) Self-Government and Independence.\nThe narrative does not follow a simple chronology of key milestones in Singapore's history, but instead opts for a more complex, networked, hybrid approach blending chronology, geography, cultures and major themes.\nWatch: RootsSG Presents: The Story of Raffles\n60 objects\nIn choosing the objects to be included, I have been guided by the following criteria:\na) that these be objects in collections owned by publicly-funded national institutions in Singapore;\nb) that these be masterpieces of art, or pieces of historical and socio-cultural significance, with a particular focus on pieces representative of significant collections of objects in public holdings;\nc) that the graphic spread as a whole is community-inclusive, by which I mean representing all ethnic communities and faiths in Singapore, with a particular effort made in representing the voices of women;\nd) that the spread be genre-inclusive, by which I mean representing a diverse variety of object types and art genres;\ne) that the spread places Singapore in the larger global, Asian and Southeast Asian context, emphasising that Singapore, and Singapore’s history, does not exist in a vacuum, but has always been open to and impacted by developments in the regional and global spheres; and finally,\nf) that the objects chosen are on physical display, as far as possible, in the permanent galleries of the institutions from which they come.\nThis story of Singapore told through 60 objects is thus unique, in that it is global, cross-cultural, multi-faith and inclusive, by which I mean it includes collections beyond the National Collection held by the National Heritage Board and displayed at the National Museums and Art Galleries. The narrative presented here also reaches back further than the now widely-accepted 700-year timeline of Singapore history. The goal of this spread is ultimately to defamiliarise; to allow our readers to see that Singapore history is rich and multi-dimensional, and that as a nation and a people, we possess a wonderful treasure trove in our museums, archives and libraries that we should preserve, cherish and celebrate.\nA) Networks through Time\nSituated at the midway point between China and India, Southeast Asia has been at the crossroads of maritime trade since the late first millennium. The Tang Shipwreck, excavated off the island of Sumatra, is testament to large-scale intra-Asian maritime trade taking place at least from the 9th century. At the same time, archaeological digs at Fort Canning and around the Singapore River provide evidence that Singapore in the 14th century was already a thriving trading settlement. There are also corroborating accounts in the Sejarah Melayu (The Malay Annals) of a Kingdom of Singapura paying tribute to the Majapahit Empire.\nFrom the 15th century, Southeast Asia takes centrestage in a global tussle among the European imperial powers to secure a monopoly on spices, and thereafter, on luxury goods from the East, in particular Chinese export porcelain and Indian trade textiles such as those in the (former) Hollander Collection of Indian Trade Cloth. Singapore’s heritage as a cosmopolitan, East-West Asian port city has its antecedents in earlier port cities like Malacca (Melaka), Batavia (Jakarta), Manila, Canton (Guangzhou) and the cities of the former Coromandel Coast (corresponding in geography to today's Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh states), from which these luxury goods from the East were exported to the rest of the world.\nAmidst this theatre of trade, war and colonialism came (English) East India Company operative, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, whose failed bid to secure the island of Java as a British colony became the impetus for his renewed search for a permanent British settlement in the lands (and seas) of the Johor-Riau-Lingga Sultanate.\nGreen Décor Hu Ewer with snake-shaped long handle and dragon head lid, North China, Tang Dynasty (618-907).\nTang Shipwreck Collection, collection of the Asian Civilisations Museum.\nThis large ewer is one of the finest ceramics found in the Tang Shipwreck and is the only one of its kind in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB) Colonial\nThe British settlement and colony of Singapore was established by treaty between Raffles, Sultan Hussein Shah and Temenggong Abdul Rahman. The signing of this treaty resulted in the division of the larger Johor-Riau-Lingga Sultanate, a powerful maritime kingdom, of which Singapore was once part of. William Farquhar, who was appointed as the first Resident, spent more time than Raffles in Singapore, and did more for the fledgling colony in his initial years. Singapore thrived through free trade and drew a cosmopolitan resident population from all across Asia and beyond.\nIn the course of the century and half that the British were in Singapore and Southeast Asia, they invested in surveying and collecting the region's natural history and cultural heritage, amassing large quantities of artefacts, specimens and drawings that were deposited at the former Raffles Library and Museum (today's National Museum of Singapore), established in 1887. The museum also plays host today to the much older William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings, commissioned by Farquhar himself in the early 1800s.\nSoutheast Asia during the colonial period of 19th to mid-20th centuries was divided and occupied by various European imperial powers: primarily the British in Singapore, Malaya, Burma (today's Myanmar) and North Borneo; the Dutch in the former Netherlands East Indies (today's Indonesia); the Spanish in the Philippines and the French in the former Indochina (today's Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos). The uneasy tension between colonial power and local agency is captured vividly in signature works of major Southeast Asian artists at the turn of the 19th century. This tension would fuel independence movements in the region post-World War II.\nBut for the time being, Singapore prospered as the foremost trading port in Southeast Asia. The advent of steam-ship and eventually air travel also established Singapore as a pre-eminent tourism destination in Asia, with the Raffles Hotel symbolising the grandeur and opulence of the East. The 1940s and '50s saw Singapore endure the atrocities of the war, the Japanese Occupation, and the aftermath. It was conferred City status in 1951.\nRecord of the 1819 Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, Singapore, 1841, ink on paper.\nCollection of the National Archives of Singapore.\nThe Treaty of Friendship and Alliance was signed on 6 February 1819 by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, representing the British East India Company (EIC) and Singapore's Malay rulers, Sultan Hussein and the Temenggong Abdul Rahman.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC) Community and Faith\nMulti-culturalism is a core facet of Singaporean identity and society. As a pre-eminent trading port in Southeast Asia, Singapore attracted, in the course of its history, ethnic and religious communities from all over Asia and Europe. Aside from the Malay, Chinese, Indian, Eurasian and various Peranakan communities—these ethnicities being themselves convenient amalgamations of many different sub-ethnicities—Singapore also welcomed Arabs, Jews, Armenians and Europeans.\nAnother important core facet of Singaporean identity and society is religious harmony, with Singapore being the most religiously diverse nation in the world. Singapore's Inter-religious Organisation today recognises 10 world religions in Singapore—the Baha'i faith, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Jainism, Judaism, Sikhism, Taoism and Zoroastrianism.\nThis section attempts to capture and present the cultural and religious diversity of Singapore, with all ethnicities and faiths represented as far as possible. Alongside masterpieces of sacred art, material culture features strongly, with film culture being represented by the Cathay-Keris Malay Classics Collection, which was inscribed into the UNESCO Memory of the World Asia-Pacific Register (2014). In the spirit of inclusiveness, particular effort has also been made to feature the stories of women in the community.\nBetel box, Riau-Lingga archipelago, mid-19th century, leather, lacquer, gold.\nCollection of Asian Civilisations Museum.\nThe custom of chewing sirih, or betel, is an ancient one. It is widespread in Asia, with almost all countries of South and Southeast Asia having once practised or still practising this custom regularly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD) Art Historical\nA proper art history of Singapore in the context of the Southeast Asian and larger Asian region would require its own full graphic spread of 60 objects. As such, this section zooms in on Singapore alone, featuring primarily Singaporean artists—one artist from the Singaporean diaspora in the United Kingdom, one pioneer Singaporean art collector, and one Chinese artist who loved Singapore.\nAn art history of modern Singapore generally commences with the Nanyang Artists, a seminal group of Singaporean painters represented by the quartet of Liu Kang, Chen Chong Swee, Chen Wen Hsi and Cheong Soo Pieng, and the enigmatic Georgette Chen. They were distinguished by their strong affiliation with the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts and by their works, which fused elements of East and West in a distinctive \"Nanyang\" (Southern Seas) style.\nThe Nanyang Artists were influenced in turn by major Chinese artists of the early 20th century such as the likes of Xu Beihong, Qi Baishi, Pu Ru, Ren Bonian, Wu Changshuo. A significant collection of these latter artists' works was built up in the 1930s to 1950s by a pioneering local merchant and philanthropist, the late Dr Tan Tsze Chor, also known as the \"pepper king\". Part of the collection, known as the Xiang Xue Zhuang Collection, was generously given to the state by Tan's family in the 2000s. Around the same period, modern Chinese painter, Wu Guanzhong, regarded as one of the most important modern Chinese painters today, also bequeathed a large gift of his artworks to the National Collection, as a gesture of his strong affection for Singapore.\nFrom the 1960s onwards, Singapore saw the emergence of major artists in various genres such as ceramics, sculpture, painting, print-making and performance art, many of whom have been awarded the Cultural Medallion—the nation's highest distinction for artists and cultural professionals.\nA distinct break occurred in the late 1980s with the radical and controversial The Artists' Village (TAV) - an artist colony, collective and movement established by contemporary artist Tang Da Wu, which counted amongst its ranks ground-breaking artists such as Amanda Heng, Chng Seok Tin and the late Lee Wen. TAV, still active today, derives its notoriety from a ban on performance art in Singapore following a performance by artist Josef Ng in 1994 which saw him snipping his pubic hair in public. TAV’s complex multi-faceted work defied categorisation and would prefigure today's new generation of local installation and multi-media artists.\nIn the meantime, the 1990s and 2000s saw significant investment by the government into the arts and culture scene, with the aim of turning around the perception of Singapore as a \"cultural desert\" and re-positioning Singapore as a \"Renaissance City\". The investment in the arts has borne fruit in terms of an extremely vibrant and active arts and heritage scene, with young Singaporean artists gaining prominence on the international stage.\nA Pair of Horses, Xu Beihong, China, c. 1940, Chinese ink and colour on paper.\nXiang Xue Zhuang Collection, in memory of Dr Tan Tsze Chor, collection of Asian Civilisations Museum.\nThe late Dr Tan Tsze Chor was one of a small group of collectors and businessmen in Singapore who were strong supporters of the arts, and were inspired by ancient examples of the Chinese literati class of painter-calligrapher-cum-collectors. He named his collection and studio Xiang Xue Zhuang 香雪庄.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE) Self-Government and Independence\nThe State of Singapore Constitution of 21 November 1958 articulated the structure of government for a self-governing Singapore, with the post of governor replaced by the office of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, and with a fully-elected Legislative Assembly. Self-government was actualised on 5 June 1959, with the late Lee Kuan Yew sworn in as Singapore's first Prime Minister, alongside his first cabinet. To mark this significant milestone, a new national flag and anthem were adopted.\nIn 1963, Singapore ceased being a colony of Great Britain by merging with Malaya, Sarawak and Sabah to form the Federation of Malaysia. Barely two years later, Singapore would leave the federation, with the Proclamation of the Republic of Singapore on 9 August 1965 declaring Singapore its own independent republic.\nSingapore's post-independence years saw significant economic growth grounded in a burgeoning manufacturing and electronics sector. Heritage brands such as Tiger Balm and Singapore's blossoming into the \"Garden City\" of Asia contributed to a more vibrant lifestyle and tourism scene.\nIn the 1980s, economic growth was accompanied by advances in the socio-cultural space, with Singapore investing in what continues to be one of the most extensive and radical public housing programmes in the world. The inclusion of a humble bus ticket from this period as the final object in the graphic spread makes a poignant statement on the great strides post-independence Singapore has made, from being a post-colonial, developing nation to today's global, first-world metropolis.\nSingapore in the 1990s and 2000s continued to sustain its growth and build on its global positioning through espousing free trade and continually diversifying its economy while enhancing its urban, social and environmental landscape and infrastructure. It is considered one of the most dynamic and liveable cities in the world today.\nSingapore (Constitution) Order in Council, 21 November 1958, Singapore.\nCollection of National Library, Singapore.\nSingapore's 1958 constitution was the culmination of three constitutional talks in 1956, 1957, and 1958—the first led by Singapore’s first Chief Minister David Marshall, and the latter two by his successor, Lim Yew Hock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe main and section text is written by the author while objects selected and the accompanying captions are edited by the author, based on recommendations and curatorial captions contributed by curators, archivists and other colleagues at Asian Civilisations Museum and Peranakan Museum, Asian Film Archive, Indian Heritage Centre, Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum, National Archives of Singapore, National Gallery Singapore, National Heritage Board, National Library Singapore, National Museum of Singapore, Singapore Art Museum and Singapore Botanic Gardens.

The Apu Trilogy is the most well known work of Indian cinema around the world. It is not so much about the storyline, but how it poetically captured life in a rural Indian village. In fact, the films do not have a conventional dramatic plot, but instead are episodic and follow the rhythm of the lives of the people they portrayed. But few if any apart from devoted Ray aficionados know that he made many more equally great films. Ray’s 36- film oeuvre comprises great and near-great films. Unlike his famed contemporaries like Bergman, Kurosawa, Fellini and Antonioni, who made a few “bad” movies along with some great ones, Ray never made a substandard, imperfect film. As the noted film critic and scholar Peter Rainer remarked: “Nobody made films like Ray before him, and it is unlikely anybody will after him.” Each lm Ray made is original and unique. No one can accuse him of “self plagiarism”. What is also remarkable is the incredible diversity and variety in his works.\nSatyajit Ray\nBiographers of Satyajit Ray and film scholars writing on his prodigious output have tried to pigeonhole him in one way or another. He has been called a Bengali Bergman, a Calcutta Chekhov or a sort of reincarnated Renoir. One critic, Michael Sragow, describes Ray as the most sublime filmmaker to emerge since Renoir and De Sica. In the West, most scholars assume that Ray, artistic and somewhat offbeat, must have emerged from India’s large and prolific motion picture tradition. In India, Ray was initially dismissed as a peddler of poverty, someone who made low budget features with foreign markets, international film festivals and awards in mind. The more discriminating marvel at Ray’s genius and call him the last titan of the nineteenth century Bengal renaissance. On the other hand, to the post-colonial theorists, Ray is a modernist in the European sense and whose work, after all is said and done, is not really as Indian as Bollywood. A proper appraisal of Ray’s cinema and his luminous legacy is still in order.\nIn 1950, Satyajit Ray was asked by a major Calcutta publisher to illustrate a children’s edition of Pather Panchali, Bibhuti Bhushan Banerjee’s semi-autobiographical novel. On his way back from London, with little to do on a two-week boat journey, Ray ended up sketching the entire book. These formed the kernel and the essential visual elements in the making of Pather Panchali, Ray’s very first film and the one that brought him instant international recognition and fame.\nPather Panchali\nAt the 1956 Cannes Film Festival, Ray received in absentia the Best Human Document Award for this hauntingly beautiful film with its carefully executed details of the joys and sorrows in the life of a little boy named Apu in a tiny village in Bengal during the 1920s. Instant fame, however, did not bring in its wake, instant fortune.\nDuring his life and filmmaking career, Ray received many honours. In addition to the Honorary Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement, which he received in 1992 in his hospital room a few weeks before he passed away, he was also presented with the Bharat Ratna, India’s highest civilian honour. Oxford University conferred on him an honorary doctorate; the University of California, Berkeley, awarded him the Berkeley Medal. In 1989, President François Mitterrand of France went to Kolkata (Calcutta) to personally award him the Légion d’honneur.\nINDIA IN RAY’S VISION\nOne can identify three major compositional periods in Ray’s life. The first period (1955-1964) was remarkable for its robust optimism, celebration of the human spirit and creative satisfaction. Ray was not only directing and scripting, but also scoring the music and taking charge of the cinematography. During this period, he directed, arguably, his greatest films. This period coincided with India’s early years of independence and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s experiments with secular democracy based on humanism, internationalism and modernism.\nThe second period (1965-1977) saw India come under a dark spell. There was war with China (1962) during Nehru’s last years, followed by a war with Pakistan (1965). Growing urban unemployment and an agricultural crisis brought about by a command economy created near-famine conditions in various parts of the country. The Vietnam War and the Cultural Revolution in China had radicalised Kolkata’s youths, artists, writers and intellectuals. Revolutionary and counterrevolutionary violence gripped the city. Kolkata, once known as a friendly and safe city, became a dangerous place to live. The Bangladesh War (1971) caused an influx of millions of refugees fleeing the Pakistani army, filling Kolkata and its outskirts. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, battling massive opposition to her government, imposed “Emergency” rule on the country. India came under draconian control, but there were few signs of serious protests: people followed orders, the streets looked cleaner, the economy showed growth, and the trains were running on time.\nRay was troubled. The films he made during this period clearly projected a troubled vision of India. The Calcutta Trilogy: The Adversary (1970), Company Limited (1971), and The Middleman (1975) created powerful portraits of alienation, waywardness, and moral collapse. Days and Nights in the Forest (1969) and Distant Thunder (1973), made during the Bangladesh War on the subject of the Bengal famine of 1943, showed rape and violence in a straightforward manner. The Chess Players,(1977) made during the “Emergency,” used the metaphor of a chess game to show how the king of Oudh, more a poet and composer than a ruler, submitted to the British takeover of his kingdom in 1856 as his people fled their villages. The two short films Pikoo (1981) and Deliverance (1981) raised the issues of adultery and untouchability. Even his so-called escapist films – the Goopy and Bagha (1968) musicals and the detective lm Golden Fortress (1974) – carried messages against wars, criminality and greed. In midlife, at the height of his creative powers, Ray seemed to have adopted a dark worldview. Socially, he became increasingly isolated.\nIn the third and last phase (1977-1992), Ray’s worldview came full circle. In the 1980s he became even more isolated and distant. In the films he made during this period, he related his messages in definitive terms. Unlike his early work, his films became didactic and frank. Gone were the carefully crafted shades of grey. Home and the World (1984), based on a Rabindranath Tagore novel, is a diatribe against nationalism, the mix of religion and politics, and political opportunism and dishonesty. Although the theme is the Swadeshi movement1 of 1905, Home and the World addressed issues of critical concern in the 1980s.\nStricken by two heart attacks, Ray was not able to make films with his characteristic vigour. He made modest family dramas, shot indoors under the watchful eyes of his doctors. He made three films, all based on his own stories, in 1988, 1989 and 1990. The first, Enemy of the People (1988), an adaptation of the Henrik Ibsen play to Bengali language, addressed questions of capitalist corruption and manipulation of religion, people, politics and environment. Branches of a Tree (1989) also addressed issues of capitalism as it impacts family values and ethics. The protagonist, a heart patient like Ray, is obsessed with honesty, mediated by mood swings of music and madness. The third film, The Stranger (1990), literally carries Ray’s own voice as he sings in parts of the film. The protagonist is clearly Ray himself. His global concerns are articulated locally. Who is an artist? Who is civilised and who is primitive? The protagonist is against narrowness of all sorts, against boundaries and borders. “Don’t be a frog in the well,” he tells his grandnephew as the film comes to an end.\nRay was a product of the Anglo-Bengali encounter of the nineteenth century. His cultural, intellectual and ideological roots can be traced to what is known as the “Bengali Renaissance.” The Bengali Renaissance refers to the flowering of Bengali arts and culture in the 19th century. As a powerfully creative artist, his craft was influenced as much by the West as by the Bengal School. One can argue that, in the final analysis, he was more than a product of the “Calcutta modern” – a synthesis of the East and the West. His creativity, he once remarked, remained grounded both in what is uniquely Bengali and in what is universal.\nTHE ART OF RAY\nLet us try to situate Satyajit Ray in his art. Our primary concern here is with his creativity – the process of creation and the person. Aristotle defined the principle of creation as nous poietikos, the poetic reason. It is a principle that can apply to the creation of the universe itself – the creative act brought into existence something that did not exist before. A human artist, by definition, cannot produce what the Great Creator has done, and produce something out of nothing. The human act of creation always involves a reshaping of given material, whether physical or mental. What are the objective conditions of this given material and its reconstitution in creative work? Philosopher Thomas Nagel has argued that objectivity cannot be studied in just Universalist terms, what he terms a view from “nowhere”. It must be identified with a positional perspective, a view from “somewhere”. In Satyajit Ray’s work, there is a creative dialogue between what is universal and what is unique to his objective conditions, between the global and the local.\nMUSIC\nMusic is another profound and uniquely personal aspect to Ray’s film art. He said while making films he thought musically – all his film narratives are structured like sonatas.\nI argue that Ray, like Tagore, was a modern innovator in revolutionising Indian music. The challenge to Ray came from the music he needed for his films. He relied at first on great musicians like Ravi Shankar, Vilayat Khan or Ali Akbar Khan. However, he was dissatisfied and started to score his own music. Here he was at his innovative best, first in Charulata, and then in his Goopy & Bagha adventure films.\nWhat kind of music did Ray compose? To what extent is it based on the traditions of India and Europe? What about his poster designs, drawings and costume sketches, book jackets, calligraphy and illustrations? And finally, what about his films?\nWhat in the final analysis emerged in all of Ray’s art is his own agency and the originality of his creation. Looking at his designs, graphics, and posters one finds a grand artist assured in the practice of his media and using it deftly to realise the idea and intent. His music has a playful melodic geometry, reduced to the barest essentials, with a focus usually on one or two timbres. The flute presents a series of apeggiated phrases forming a musical signature of its own. One can say the same thing about his films: they show a radical simplicity, concealing layer upon layer of ingenuity and complex composition. These defy all labels, and the only one that seems apt and appropriate is Ray’s own unique signature in all his work.\nWhen an interviewer addressed Akira Kurosawa “the master”, he responded by saying “Not me. Ray is the master. Not to have seen his films is like living on earth and not seeing the Sun and the Moon.”\nAbout the writer: A consultant for the Satyajit Ray Retrospective organised by the National Museum of Singapore, Dilip K.

Photo Credit: Annabelle Liang\nBeing an avid collector of Chinese art, the late Dr Tan Tsze Chor regularly hosted dinner parties at home. The property had to be dressed to entertain. This was a task for his son, Mr Tan Gek Gnee. Growing up, Mr Tan was regularly handed a list of paintings that needed to be displayed.\n“I would search for them and hang them on the walls in our gallery,” Mr Tan said. “My father would inspect how the paintings were hung. The height and distance between them had to be correct. More importantly, they needed to look pleasant to the eye,” he added.\n“That was how detailed and serious his character was, whether with work or his love for art,” Mr Tan, who is now in his 60s, explained.\nSimple beginnings\nDr Tan was born in Singapore in 1911. He returned to China with his parents in 1917 for his studies, but made another trip to the city-state years later to find work.\nAt hardly 16 years of age, Dr Tan found a job as a peon. That was when he grew interested in calligraphy. At night, he religiously practised writing, using newspapers because he could get them for free.\n“My father told me that when you make a mistake while painting, you can correct it by covering the area with another colour or pattern,” Mr Tan said.\n“But with calligraphy, if a dot or stroke is too thick, it is not possible to correct the mistake because the word will look awkward,” he added.\nDr Tan slowly carved a name for himself at work and in the realm of art. He became a successful Teochew businessman, dealing with pepper, gambier, rubber, coffee, and other local produce.\nDr Tan’s calligraphy was exhibited in Singapore and Taiwan.\nGetting to know artists\nDr Tan frequently reached out to artists, to get a better understanding of their paintings. He made friends with Chinese artists like Xu Beihong, Qi Baishi, Zhang Daqian, and Huang Binhong.\nHis collection and studio, named Xiang Xue Zhuang, had valuable masterpieces by Xu, Qi, Ren Yi, and Pan Tianshou, among others. The name Xiang Xue Zhuang was an allusion to the fragrance of the plum blossom.\nAt its peak between the 1950s and 1980s, there were over a few hundred objects in the collection. This included paintings, commissioned portraits of Dr Tan and his wife, porcelains, and other objects.\nWhile most items were brought to his attention, Dr Tan would buy high quality ceramics from New York and London.\nWhen Mr Tan and his siblings were born, Dr Tan doted on them and regularly took his family to the movies and to restaurants for dinner. He continued to practise calligraphy twice a week.\nMr Tan recalled making folds on rice paper so his father could write weekly. “His calligraphy has its own style. When people see it, they know straight away that it is the work of Dr Tan Tsze Chor,” Mr Tan said.\nIn 1977, Dr Tan worked with the Singapore Art Society to set up the Tan Tsze Chor Art Fund, to support the development of local art and artists.\nIn recognition of his contribution to the arts, Dr Tan was conferred an honorary doctorate by the Hua Gang College of Chinese Culture, part of the present-day Chinese Culture University in Taiwan.\nMr Tan Tsze Chor passed away in 1983.\nValuable gifts of art\nSince 2000, the Tan family has donated over 100 works from Dr Tan's collection to the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM). They also donated close to 500 volumes from Dr Tan’s collection of books on Chinese art to the ACM library.\nIn 2003 to 2004, an exhibition of the paintings and ceramics given by the family of Dr Tan Tsze Chor was presented at ACM’s premises in Armenian Street. A gallery was also named in Dr Tan’s honour.\nTo mark the publication of the Xiang Xue Zhuang Collection catalogue, a display of objects from the collection was held at the Tan Tsze Chor ACM from 2006 to 2007.\nAfter Dr Tan's death, the Tan family agreed to grow the Tan Tsze Chor Art Fund. At that time, the money was put in a bank. Any interest it garnered was offered as prize money at a yearly art competition.\nThey grew the fund significantly and decided to invest in equities to get a better rate of return.\n“We hope to invest wisely and build up the fund, so that we will be able to increase the prize money in the future,” Mr Tan said.\nMr Tan is currently the Managing Director of Chiang Hong Private Limited, a company that his father started. Over the years, it has veered off distributing food items and now deals with investments instead.\n“Because my father was a perfectionist, being his right-hand man, I have learned to follow in his footsteps,” Mr Tan shared.\nAmong the items, a painting of horses by Xu Beihong and a set of his father's calligraphic works are Mr Tan's favourites.\n“Our family wanted to honour our father and decided to donate the best of his Chinese art collection to ACM,” Mr Tan said. “The objective was to carry on his legacy of promoting Chinese works of art, by sharing his art collection with the general public.”\nMr Tan hopes the collection will speak to Singaporeans and especially the young.\n“Good design sells products from cars to houses, furniture, and phones. We hope that young artistic minds will be stimulated, once they have the opportunity to study beautiful artworks on display in the museums,” Mr Tan said.\n“Eventually, they may be able to create artefacts that are even more beautiful,” he quipped.\nBy ANNABELLE LIANG", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/patrons-of-heritage/Dr-Tan-Tsze-Chor", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/patrons-of-heritage/tan-tsze-chor/mr-tan8alforweb.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:44"},

The Singapore Stone, an ancient relic that was discovered in 1819 at the mouth of the Singapore River, is an iconic marker of Singapore’s pre-1819 history.\nThe original stone measured 3m by 3m in its day. Legend even points to it as the boulder hurled by Badang – a folk hero known for his great strength who served the king of Singapura in 14th century Singapore - during a contest with a foreign champion.\nUnfortunately, a British engineer blew up the stone in 1843 during a project to widen the river mouth, and a fragment survives today at the National Museum of Singapore.\nInscribed with an indecipherable script which some experts have claimed to be old Javanese or Sanskrit (Sir Stamford Raffles himself guessed the script to be of Indian origin), the Singapore Stone continues to baffle historians even till today.\n...Singapore’s first “Bankers” traded\nChettiar moneylender’s pettagam (storage chest), 1930s.\nCollection of the National Museum of Singapore. Gift of Mr Subbiah Lakshmanan.\nAs a trading emporium and centre of commerce, the early days of the Singapore River saw Indian Chettiars from Tamil Nadu play the role of Singapore’s first financiers.\nArriving in the 1820s, they opened moneylending businesses in the Singapore River area, primarily along Chulia Street and Market Street.\nBack then, the average Chettiar would sit cross-legged on the ground floor of a kittangi (warehouse). The pettagam, or storage chest, served as a desk on which they conducted their business.\nA kittangi provided all the services of a modern bank for Singapore’s early entrepreneurs. They financed everything from rubber to real estate. They provided working capital loans, took deposits and even offered fund transfers.\nWith the passing of time, the descendants of Singapore’s Chettiar community went on to take up other professions.\n...secret societies thrived\nChinese secret society identification token, undated\nCollection of the National Museum of Singapore.\nSecret societies were rampant along the river banks during the 19th century. Tokens were carried around by society members, for secret identification of their roles within the society hierarchy.\nEarly Chinese immigrants fresh off the boats in Singapore were often greeted by secret society members who would call to them in their native dialects, offering friendship, a sense of belonging and identity, and practical assistance.\nFor many, joining the ranks of these secret societies was the easiest way to link up with a towkay or businessman in order to get jobs pulling rickshaws or picking gambier.\nThe brokers of these secret societies in China would even offer to pay for their boat fare to Singapore if they could not afford it. As a result, many of the poorer immigrants would step off their ships already saddled with years’ worth of debt.\nIn their prime, the secret societies were immensely powerful. They collected protection money from the riverside godowns, operated gambling dens, brothels and opium houses. By 1881, nearly half of the 73,000 Chinese immigrants in Singapore were members.\nThe social disorder caused by the existence of these secret societies eventually forced the colonial government to intervene directly. Despite being outlawed in 1889, their presence continued to be felt well into the 20th century.\n...Godowns for Gambier and other Spices were\nDrawing of Gambier from the William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings, early 19th century.\nCollection of the National Museum of Singapore.

After harvest, the leaves of the plant were boiled down, squeezed and dried to make an extract that resembles burnt marshmallows.\nFrom there, it was carted to shops along the Singapore River. Clarke Quay’s oldest building, the River House, was once a godown that stored gambier.\nIn the 1830s, Singapore’s gambier industry flourished, largely due to demand from British tanning businesses.

While many countries have national flowers too, the orchid is more than a national flower in Singapore’s case. It is also a tool used in Singapore’s diplomatic relations. This essay explores this little-known aspect of our natural heritage.\nText by Theiswar Murali, Ng Ping Siang\n2022, Theiswar Murali\nWhat do you think of when the word ‘orchid’ comes to mind? Chances are, you might remember it as the national flower of Singapore, Vanda Miss Joaquim, which is named after Agnes Joaquim, a renowned horticulturalist. But did you know that Agnes Joaquim is not the only figure to have an orchid hybrid named after her? The naming of orchid hybrids after heads of states and equivalent VIPs, also known as orchid diplomacy, has been a longstanding effort in Singaporean natural heritage. As such, the orchid is more than just a national flower – it is a flower that establishes Singapore on the international stage as well.\nOrchids are unique in that viable, fertile offspring can be produced from the crossbreeding of species not only within the same genus but also from different related genera, making it possible for a great variety of hybrids to be created. By the 1950s, Singapore had established her reputation as a centre for excellence in orchid hybridisation and cultivation. Renowned orchid breeder Tan Hoon Siang’s Papilionanda Tan Chay Yan - a showy, peach and salmon coloured orchid - won a First-Class Certificate at the Chelsea Flower Show in London in 1954, placing Singapore on the world map for orchid hybridisation and cultivation. This was a win that placed Singapore at the forefront of orchid breeding efforts.\nThen Director of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, Richard Eric Holttum, was inspired by Vanda Miss Joaquim, which was popularly grown in many Singaporean households then, to experiment in the field of orchid hybridisation. Holttum employed Lewis Knudson’s revolutionary method of asymbiotic orchid germination (a method that accelerated the growth of seedlings in controlled conditions) in 1928 to produce his first orchid hybrid, Spathoglottis Primrose, which flowered in 1931. Holttum continued to create many more hybrids, registering a total of 28 hybrids during his 27 years of employment at the Gardens. Hybrids created by Holttum like Aranthera James Storie and Aranda Deborah were used for export and contributed to the growth of the cut flower industry in Singapore.\nAranthera Anne Black was the first orchid hybrid which was part of Singapore’s orchid diplomacy initiative, named after Lady Anne Black, wife of the former Governor of Singapore, in 1956. 2022, Theiswar Murali.\nBuilding upon the firm foundation set by Holttum, the Singapore Botanic Gardens developed a uniquely Singaporean diplomatic technology, using orchids as symbols of diplomacy with other states. With more than 200 registered hybrids named after visiting heads of states and equivalent VIPs, orchid diplomacy remains one of Singapore’s unique approaches when it comes to fostering relations with other countries today.\nSingapore has long employed the gifting of orchids. Looking at its history, one traces Singapore’s orchid diplomacy all the way back to 1956 when the first orchid, Aranthera Anne Black, was named after Lady Anne Black, wife of Singapore’s former governor Sir Robert Black. In a more contemporaneous context, the orchid hybrid, Papilionanda Kamala Harris, was named after the Vice President of the United States of America, Kamala Harris, during her official visit to Singapore on 23 August 2021.\nToday, a prized collection of these VIP orchids has become an important attraction of the National Orchid Garden. Why is it such an important tool in Singapore’s context?\nImportance of Orchid Diplomacy\nWorking on this potential of the orchid, Singapore has refined it into a diplomatic tool by specialising in orchid breeding – a form of diplomacy to signify her relations with other nations.\nOrchid diplomacy serves as a gesture of friendship to promote goodwill and foster closer ties between Singapore and other countries. An exclusive gesture accorded to foreign dignitaries – such as with the U.S. Vice President stated above – it plays an important role in fostering and building Singapore’s bilateral relations. To date, Singapore is the only country in the world to have such an orchid diplomacy initiative.\nNow the question remains – why does such a diplomatic tool matter for Singapore? As with China and panda diplomacy, orchids are in this case, Singapore’s “pandas”. As a maritime hub that connects multiple countries together, Singapore’s bilateral relations are of utmost importance to her identity and survival. Furthermore, the lack of natural resources often places Singapore at a disadvantaged position when dealing on the international table. Just as how the creation of NEWater has generated an alternative route of water, orchid breeding is another display of scientific effort by Singapore to improve its ties with the world.\n\nFormer president Yusof Ishak with Raja Permaisuri Agong Tengku Budriah of Malaysia at the Singapore Botanic Gardens’ Orchid Enclosur 1963, National Archives Singapore: https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/b3667550-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad\nIn a world with rising globalisation and transnational movements, international relations are becoming even more pertinent in this context. As an international hub and “heart” of such a globalising world, orchid diplomacy is thus a crucial part of our heritage and Singapore’s identity.\nLocated within the Singapore Botanic Gardens, the National Orchid Garden has the largest and most comprehensive permanent tropical orchid display in Asia, with over 1,500 orchid species and 2,000 orchid hybrids on display. It comprises thematic display areas such as the VIP Orchid Garden and Celebrity Orchid Garden. Most recently, enhancements have been undertaken to rejuvenate the National Orchid Garden, culminating in the opening of the Tropical Montane Orchidetum in April 2021. The Tropical Montane Orchidetum consists of The Sembcorp Cool House, the Yuen Peng McNeice Bromeliad Collection, and the Tan Hoon Siang Mist House, and has provided the Gardens more opportunities to hybridise orchid species from different habitats, further strengthening its capabilities in orchid hybridisation.\nAbout Partner\nTheiswar Murali and Ng Ping Siang are budding historians pursuing the Bachelor of Arts (Hons) in History programme at Nanyang Technological University.

This is how a mere trading port grew into the international hub we know today. Back in the days when a journey to far off lands usually meant a long sea voyage, ports were the hubs of exchange – a merchant’s gateway to international trade, a captain’s safe harbour to refuel and a land of opportunity for anyone willing to work hard.\nWhen it was called Temasek, Singapore was one of many port cities situated along the Straits of Malacca; the gateway in and out of Southeast Asia. It had a deep sea harbour and was strategically located between India and China, making it a promising entrepot.\nPrint showing the Singapore River bustling with activity (c. 1876. Image from National Museum of Singapore.)\nSingapore’s growth as a port\nLeveraging the island’s reputation as an ancient port of importance with traders in the region, the groundwork laid by Major-General William Farquhar and aspirations of Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819 caused Singapore to become one of the premier places for international trade, business and success.\nIn contrast to the Dutch – another maritime power that controlled trade in the Malay Archipelago – the decision by Raffles to make Singapore a free port attracted merchants from the region and beyond. In just two years, almost 3,000 vessels with 200,000 tonnes of cargo visited the port, and in four years, the population had grown to more than 10,000.\nScene of the crowded Singapore River and Fort Canning (c. Late 19th-early 20th century. Image from National Museum of Singapore.)\nAlong the winding river, Boat Quay would be the first stretch to experience the transformation. This particular part of the river became known as the “Belly of the Carp” because of its curved shape which resembled the fish, deemed an auspicious symbol by the Chinese. It was at this location that many godowns and warehouses were built. It quickly became crowded with cargo-packed bumboats. The sight of junks and cargo boats with flapping sails became a common sight on the river.\nSingapore soon became one of the most popular ports to trade at. Besides serving as the centre of trade in Southeast Asia, the island overtook Batavia as the main hub for Chinese junk trade. This was only the beginning, and Singapore eventually supplanted the Riau Islands as the export gateway for the gambier and pepper industry of the Riau-Lingga Archipelago, as well as South Johor. Even the Teochew trade in marine produce and rice came to our shores.\nConstructing roads and architecture\nA significant milestone in the evolution of the port was the construction of roads and railways to support the bustling sea trade. Primary materials such as crude oil, rubber and tin from the Malay Peninsula were transported to Singapore for further processing into staple products, before being shipped off to Britain and other international markets.\nBesides the merchants and businessmen, the types of visitors started to grow to include a mix of travellers and seamen. “La Favourite”, a French corvette on a voyage to sail around the world, also found respite in Singapore’s safe harbour for five days en route to far-off New Zealand.\nThis print (aquatint) shows the French corvette ‘La Favorite’, under the command of Captain Cyrille Laplace, which sailed eastwards around the world between 1830 and 1833. (c. 1856. Image from National Museum of Singapore.)\nRaffles directed land on the north bank to be reserved for government buildings; the east of this plot was allocated to the Europeans, and further east for the Arabs and Bugis. However, the needs of commerce thwarted this plan to some extent, as both European and Asian merchants preferred to locate their businesses by the riverside. Flat and spacious river banks were soon lined with trade houses. These diversified the landscape and were soon followed by the brick warehouses, also known as godowns, ready to receive and store goods arriving on Singapore’s shores.\nOcean-faring vessels were too large to navigate the shallow waters of Singapore River. Instead, smaller flat-bottomed craft called lighters or bumboats would ferry cargo between these ships and the docks at the river.\nThe first stretch of the Singapore River to be developed, Boat Quay originated with Singapore’s first land reclamation project to build an embankment. This part of the river, popularly known as the “Belly of the carp”, brimmed with traditional cargo boats until the Singapore River clean-up was completed in the 1980s.\nCommercial hubs such as Raffles Place, Market Street and Fullerton Square also emerged in the river’s vicinity as merchants and bankers gathered to exchange news and seize business opportunities, forming one of the key economic pillars of independent Singapore.\nThe Singapore River Settlement was captured by artist Percy Carpenter in the “View of Singapore from Mount Wallich” (which has now since been levelled for the land reclamation of Telok Ayer) in the 1850s. One can identify other landmarks in the painting such as the Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Cathedral of the Good Shepherd and St Andrew’s Church.\nBut architecture and buildings were not the only things brightening up river life. The river was also filled with people of diverse communities who came from various parts of the world; some for work, and some for rest and recreation.\nPeople along the River\nArmies of coolies, lightermen and stevedores (dockworkers) toiled to unload bales of merchandise into riverside shops and warehouses, while new arrivals came ashore to seek their kinsmen and business associates, or look for work. After a long, hard day work, many who worked by the river would unwind on bridges such as Read Bridge and Coleman Bridge to enjoy a drink and listen to traditional storytellers.\nThese storytellers would entertain the river communities with tall tales and live music. At a time when literacy was low, newspaper readers would also draw crowds, serving an important function by keeping everyone abreast of the latest happenings.\nThis mingling of people from all corners of the globe led to cultures and traditions intersecting and interacting on a daily basis on our shores. The port built upon the banks of the Singapore River facilitated not just an exchange of goods, but also of cultures and dreams of building a future.\nThe Singapore River no longer functions as a harbour for trade, but it continues to flow past important landmarks, buildings and neighbourhoods that serve as a reminder of how modern Singapore began; with the establishment of a trading settlement and through the diverse communities who built and shaped it into the international hub it is today.", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/belly-of-the-carp/belly-of-the-carp", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/belly-of-the-carp/belly-of-the-carp-1138519.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:44"},

In Singapore, maps are especially significant as they are the earliest material evidence of our past. Text by Tan Huism\nMuseSG Volume 8 Issue 1 – Apr to Jun 2015\nMaps are fascinating objects. Visual and textual, they tell us about the world they depict and provide a glimpse into the worldview of their makers. In Singapore, maps are especially significant as they are the earliest material evidence of our past.\nAs part of Geo|Graphic: Celebrating Maps and their Stories, exhibitions and programmes were organized by the National Library that explored maps and mapping in both historical and contemporary contexts. They ran until 19 July 2015.\nThe two historical exhibitions — Land of Gold and Spices: Early Maps of Southeast Asia and Singapore, and Island of Stories: Singapore Maps — showcase the collections of the National Library and the National Archives of Singapore respectively. They provide amazing insight into the history and transformation of Singapore’s landscape, and how Southeast Asia was imagined and mapped by the Europeans.\nGeo|Graphic’s contemporary art components, Mind the Gap: Mapping the Other, and SEA STATE 8 seabook: An Art Project by Charles Lim (co-organised with the NUS Museum), invited visitors to reflect on the concepts of mapping and what maps might look like in the hands of an artist.\nHere are some highlights from the exhibitions Land of Gold and Spices and Island of Stories.\nMap featuring a naval battle by Theodore de Bry, Frankfurt, 1607. | Collection of National Library, Singapore\nPrinted in 1607, this is a schematic map of a brutal Luso-Dutch naval confrontation that took place between 6 and 11 October 1603, in the Johor River (Rio Batusabar) and close to Pedra Branca (Pedro Blanca). The Johor Fleet (allies of the Dutch) is shown waiting at a shoal off the eastern coast of Singapore. The map, produced by Flemish goldsmith, engraver and publisher Theodore de Bry (1528–98), has been drawn with the east orientated to the top.\nOne of the earliest representations of Singapore’s coastline, the map is also significant for depicting the battle that illustrates the strategic importance of the Singapore Strait as a waterway connecting the Indian ocean to the South China Sea.\nStrait of Singapore, circa 1675-1700 | Collection of Leiden University Library\nThis hand-drawn chart that shows the Straat Sincapura (Strait of Singapore) is a V.O.C. (Dutch East India Company)-based chart and might have been derived from an earlier version. The outline of the Long Island (‘t Lang Eylant) referring to Singapore is not completed at the northern part, perhaps reflecting the cartographer’s lack of knowledge of the area. To the south of the strait, a large landmass can be seen. It has a phrase stating that to the southern side of the Singapore Strait are broken islands, or gebrooken eilanden. The cartographer has not drawn the outline of the numerous islands, as little is known about them. This chart with soundings and compass-rose lines, however, identifies two navigational landmarks in the Singapore Strait: Johor Hill and the twin peaks of Bintan, both of which are highlighted in black ink.\nDetail of a map of Singapore and the Melaka Strait by Jacques Nicolas Bellin, Paris, 1755 | Collection of National Library, Singapore\nJacques Nicolas Bellin (1703–72) was a French hydrographer who created maps for several key publications in the 18th century. On this map, Bellin depicts the island of Singapore and calls it Pulo or Isle Panjang (Pulau Panjang, meaning Long Island in Malay, or Panjang Island). If the main island of Singapore is named at all on early European maps, it is most often called Pulau Panjang. On this map, the old Strait of Singapore (Vieux Detroit de Sincapour) is shown as the waterway between Singapore and Johor, which is known today as the Johor or Tebrau Strait (Selat Tebrau in Malay).\nInterestingly, Bellin shows two islands on the Johor Strait: Salat Buro and Joor. It seems that Salat Buro, or Selat Tebrau, has been mistakenly depicted as an island; similarly, Joor is presumed to be Johor Lama. The two islands depicted are likely to be present-day Pulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong. The lack of knowledge on most European maps about the Johor Strait suggests that European navigators did not use this maritime route much.\nSingapore Harbour: Proposed improvements, 1904 | Singapore Harbour Board collection | Courtesy of National Archives of Singapore\nBy the early 20th century, Singapore, dubbed the “Gateway to the East”, had become a major international port serving the thriving trade between Asia and Europe. The sheer volume of ships and cargo that Singapore handled strained its port’s infrastructure, which had become inadequate to meet its growing requirements by the late 19th century. This necessitated major harbour improvements, and this map of the Singapore harbour shows the proposed harbour improvement works drawn up in 1904 by the British government’s consulting engineer Coode, Son & Matthews. It contains hydrographic details, including the soundings of the harbour, and the direction and velocity of the harbour’s tides.\nSome of the proposed improvements included plans to reclaim land to extend and straighten the wharf at Telok Ayer to make it easier and safer for ships to dock; to deepen the harbour; and to construct a series of moles, or breakwaters. But due to budget and technical difficulties, and public outcry against the move, only the southern inner mole was built.

For instance, Capitol Cinema, Cathay Cinema and Raffles Hotel were renamed Kyo-Ei Gekijo (共榮), Dai To’a Gekijo (大東亜劇場) and Shonan Ryokan (昭南旅館), respectively. The selective renaming of such public landmarks allowed the Japanese administration to assert sovereignty over Syonan-to — Singapore’s name during the Occupation — without causing widespread confusion.\nTan Huism is Head, Exhibitions and Curation with the National Library, Singapore.", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/geo-graphic-celebrating-maps-and-their-stories/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/geo-graphic-celebrating-maps-and-their-stories/geographic-celebrating-maps-3.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:44"},

It serves as a reminder of the contributions of Chinese pioneers and their historic connection to the 1911 Chinese Revolution. Location\nNational Monuments sksks\n12 Tai Gin Road, Singapore 327873\nGet Directions\nSun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall is one of the few surviving examples of villas that were once common sights in British Singapore. As its name clearly suggests, the building is strongly linked to the Chinese revolutionary Sun Yat Sen (孙中山). Moreover, it serves as a reminder of the contributions of Chinese pioneers and their historic connection to the 1911 Chinese Revolution (辛亥革命).\nPrivate Villa\nBoey Chuan Poh (梅春辅 or 梅泉宝), a wealthy Chinese merchant, built the spacious villa in 1902 on a land parcel that had been part of a sugar plantation owned by Joseph Balestier, the first American Consul appointed to Singapore, and called it Bin Chan House (明珍庐). In 1905, Teo Eng Hock (张永福), a Teochew businessman and uncle of the rubber magnate Lim Nee Soon (林义顺), bought the villa as a retirement home for his mother. He renamed it Wan Qing Yuan (晩晴园), which remains a popular moniker for the estate today.\nSun Yat Sen\nSun Yat Sen was a Chinese revolutionary who was instrumental in overthrowing the Qing dynasty to establish a Chinese republic in 1912. Fondly remembered as the first Chinese president, Sun founded the Republic of China upon his Three Principles of the People (三民主义): nationalism (民族主义), democracy (民权主义), and welfare (民生主义).\nIn July 1905, Sun became acquainted with Teo Eng Hock, Lim Nee Soon, and Hokkien merchant Tan Chor Lam (陈楚南) in Singapore when he was en route to Europe from Japan. In April the following year, he came to Singapore. After consulting with his mother, Teo invited Sun to stay at Wan Qing Yuan. In the subsequent years, Sun frequented Nanyang (南洋, or Southeast Asia) to garner support from the locals for his planned revolution against the Qing imperial government.\nBase for the Chinese Revolutionaries\nSun made Wan Qing Yuan his residence and operational base whenever he visited Singapore. It was in the villa that he established the Singapore branch of Tongmenghui (同盟会, or Chinese Revolutionary Alliance) in 1906. Wan Qing Yuan became Sun’s headquarters in Nanyang for the propagation of his revolutionary ideas and the coordination of various activities in the region. Three uprisings in Qing China to overthrow the Manchu government – Huanggang Uprising (黄冈起义, May 1907), Zhennanguan Uprising (镇南关起义, December 1907), and Hekou Uprising (河口起义, April 1908) – were devised and launched at the villa. The building had also welcomed fellow revolutionaries and prominent leaders of modern China from the region, such as Wang Jingwei (汪精卫), Hu Hanmin (胡汉民), and Huang Xing (黄兴).\nIn addition, Sun also made four designs of the ‘Blue Sky, White Sun, and Wholly Red Earth’ (青天白日满地红) flag at Wan Qing Yuan, and had even requested Teo’s wife to embroider the designs. With the support of Chinese communities around the world, including those in Singapore who laboured zealously and contributed generously to the revolutionary cause, Sun’s movement finally succeeded in toppling the Qing government in 1911. Sun passed away in 1925.\nMemorial Hall\nAfter Teo sold off Wan Qing Yuan in 1910, the villa changed ownership several times. Six Chinese community leaders – Lee Kong Chian (李光前), Tan Ean Kiam (陈延谦), Chew Hean Swee (周献瑞), Lee Chin Tian (李振殿), Lee Choon Seng (李俊承), and Yeo Kiat Tiow (杨吉兆) – collectively purchased the estate in 1937 and donated it to the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce (known as the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry today) the following year. In 1940, the Nanjing Government of the Republic of China granted funds for the renovation of Wan Qing Yuan to transform it into a memorial hall dedicated to Sun.\nSecond World War\nWhen the Japanese invaded Singapore, the Japanese military took over the estate and used it as a communication base. After the war, Kuomintang (国民党, Nationalist Government of China) contributed to the restoration of the villa and founded an overseas political branch at Wan Qing Yuan. The branch was subsequently prohibited by the British Administration in 1949. Wan Qing Yuan was returned to the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and refurbished once again, before it was reopened in 1966 as Sun Yat Sen Villa.\nArchitecture\nA typical colonial villa in Singapore, Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall is well adapted to the tropical climate of the region. Verandahs on both sides of the villa act as buffers between the walls and the scorching sunrays, while large windows ensured ample air ventilation before the advent of air-conditioning. Above the projecting porte-cochere (carriage porch) was a sitting area for the residents, which is now a spacious open room supported by stately Corinthian columns. Lining the perimeters of the upper floor are cast-iron railings with an intricate design, while the roof eaves are adorned with filigree fascia.\nThe villa is situated in a beautiful compound. Besides lush greenery, two bronze statues of Sun Yat Sen – one seated and the other standing – can be found in the garden. There is also a long bronze wall mural that depicts scenes from early twentieth-century Singapore.\nSun Yat Sen Memorial Hall Today\nWan Qing Yuan was renamed Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall in 1997. After the National Heritage Board took over the management of the former residence in 2009, the estate underwent yet another phase of development. It was reopened to the public on the centenary anniversary of the 1911 Chinese Revolution in 2011.\nSun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall seeks to present to its visitors the 1911 Chinese Revolution from the perspectives of Chinese communities living in Singapore and Nanyang.\nOur National Monuments\nOur National Monuments are an integral part of Singapore’s built heritage, which the National Heritage Board (NHB) preserves and promotes for posterity. They are monuments and sites that are accorded the highest level of protection in Singapore.\nFormer Sun Yat Sen Villa", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/places/places-landing/Places/national-monuments/former-sun-yat-sen-villa-now-sun-yat-sen-nanyang-memorial-hall", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/monuments/038-former-sun-yat-sen-villa/former-sun-yat-sen-villa.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:45"},

Bhai Sarbat telah menjual sarabat dan kegemaran tempatan lainnya kepada pelanggan sejak tahun 1950-an semasa perniagaan minuman dimulakan oleh seorang pendatang dari India yang dikenali sebagai Firuz.\nPertama kali berniaga sebagai gerai beca, Bhai Sarbat akhirnya beroperasi di sebuah rumah kedai pada tahun 1970-an. Semasa pemilik sekarang Mohammad Asgar membeli perniagaan tersebut pada tahun 2018, dia menamakan kedai itu Bhai Sarbat (\"Saudara Sarbat\" dalam bahasa Hindi dan Urdu) setelah mendengar pelanggan merujuk kepada nama julukannya.\nKejayaan kedai ini dibina berdasarkan populariti teh sarbat dan teh tarik biasa, teh sarbat adalah campuran teh dan pati halia. Dalam budaya Arab, Parsi dan India, sharbat, dari mana sarabat berasal, umumnya difahami sebagai minuman manis, biasanya berasaskan sirap. Namun, istilah ini juga digunakan untuk teh halia yang ditarik di Singapura dan Malaysia.\nTeh sarabat dan teh tarik dibuat dengan teh hitam dan susu pekat, dan pakar pembuat teh Bhai Sarbat menunjukkan bakat masing-masing menggunakan teknik yang berbeza. Ditarik di antara dua koleh, teknik dan panjang tarikan yang berbeza-beza secara halus mengubah suhu dan rasa teh sambil menghasilkan lapisan atas yang berbuih.\nUntuk memenuhi selera yang sentiasa berubah-rubah, Asgar telah memperluas menu minuman dari 12 hingga lebih dari 120 minuman, dan mejadikan anaknya Zaki sebagai pakar teh generasi seterusnya. Hari ini, aliran pelanggan baru dan tetap berterusan mengunjungi kedai itu.\nPenapis teh kain nilon digunakan untuk menyaring teh atau serbuk kopi untuk minuman di Bhai Sarbat, termasuk teh halia dan teh tarik yang terkenal.\nAttar turun temurun: Aromatik Jamal Kazura\nSejak tahun 1933, Jamal Kazura Aromatics telah membuat banyak jenis minyak wangi yang merangkumi berbagai aroma. Perniagaan ini diasaskan sebagai Syarikat Kazura oleh Mohamed Hanifa bin Mohamed Shariff, yang telah berhijrah ke Singapura dari India Selatan melalui Kepulauan Riau.\nKedai pertama Hanifa terletak di 728 North Bridge Road, dan pada tahun-tahun awalnya, dia menjual berbagai barang, termasuk buku, batu permata, pakaian dan minyak wangi. Ramai pelanggannya bakal jemaah haji dan berhimpun di Masjid Sultan yang berdekatan.\nSetelah mengambil alih perniagaan ini pada pertengahan tahun 1970-an, anak pengasasnya Mohamed Jamal bin Mohamed Hanifa menamakan semula perniagaan itu sebagai Jamal Kazura Aromatics dan memberi tumpuan kepada penjualan minyak wangi, minyak pati dan setanggi. Perniagaan kemudian mengkhususkan penjualan minyak wangi tanpa alkohol yang dikenali sebagai attar dalam bahasa Arab. Berabad-abad lamanya, attar mempunyai kedudukan tinggi dalam masyarakat Islam di seluruh dunia, dengan sebilangan umat Islam memakai wangian pada diri mereka sebelum solat.\nDengan menggunakan minyak pati seperti safron, cendana dan setanggi, Jamal mengadun dan mencipta sebilangan minyak wangi khas, termasuk yang paling laris \"Symphony\" dan \"Sultan\". Anak-anak Jamal, yang kini merupakan pengurus generasi ketiga perniagaan, masih ingat mereka pergi ke sekolah dengan wangian berbagai aroma kerana bapa mereka akan menguji minyak wangi ke atas mereka.\nMulai tahun 1990-an, perniagaan itu memperluaskan rangkaian jenis-jenis minyak wangi untuk memenuhi selera yang sentiasa berkembang dan pelanggan-pelanggan dari  berbagai etnik, agama, termasuk penganut Buddha membeli dupa cendana dan orang Kristian membeli setanggi. Pada tahun 2009, cucu pengasas Johari Kazura membuka Sifr Aromatics di 42 Arab Street, menawarkan lebih banyak rangkaian minyak wangi khusus dan mengekalkan seni warisan dan inovasi keluarganya.\nGambar pengasas Syarikat Kazura, Mohamed Hanifa bin Mohamed Shariff (tengah) bersama dua rakan perniagaan dari Switzerland.\nMakanan warisan, masyarakat dan adat: Rumah Makan Minang\nDidirikan pada awal 1980-an, Rumah Makan Minang adalah salah satu pewaris restoran Sabar Menanti yang asal. Membesar dan bekerja di gerai Sabar Menanti yang dikendalikan oleh keluarga, pemilik Zulbaidah binte Marlian mempunyai pengalaman langsung tentang bagaimana ibunya Hajjah Rosemah binte Mailu, contoh berdikari, tokoh wanita yang dihormati dalam budaya Minangkabau. Mengikuti jejak ibunya, Zulbaidah mengasaskan rumah nasi padang sendiri, iaitu Rumah Makan Minang, bersama suaminya Mohamed Zin bin Harun.\nSalah satu sajian utama nasi padang adalah rendang iaitu masakan daging lembu, rempah dan kelapa yang direnih lama yang berasal dari orang Minangkabau tetapi juga telah disesuaikan dengan masakan dari daerah lain. Rendang Rumah Makan Minang mengekalkan gaya masakan lebih kering dan gelap disajikan di Sungai Limau, Sumatera Barat, tempat Rosemah dilahirkan.\nHidangan popular lain di restoran itu adalah ayam belado hijau (ayam goreng dengan sambal belado hijau khas) dan paru belado merah (paru-paru lembu goreng dengan sambal belado merah), yang bahan utamanya dimasak dengan sambal belado, bumbu cili kasar yang banyak digunakan dalam masakan Minangkabau. Ciri khas masakan Minangkabau adalah penggunaan santan dan kelapa parut segar dan bukannya kerisik.\nTeknik memasak dan resipi Rumah Makan Minang yang disebutkan di atas, membawa pengalaman turun temurun tiga generasi, dari Hajjah Rosemah dan Haji Marlian hingga Zulbaidah dan Zin, dan anak-anak mereka, Hazmi, Syahidah, Ariff dan Nazri. Di bawah pengurusan mereka, perniagaan itu membuka dapur pusat untuk memastikan keselarasan dan mutu  makanan mereka, dan menambahkan cabang baru di Tampines pada tahun 2017. Rendang mereka juga telah dipamerkan di menu warisan Shangri-La Hotel, meskipun resipinya tetap menjadi rahsia keluarga.\nGambar ini menunjukkan lokasi Rumah Makan Minang sebelumnya, yang menduduki tiga unit rumah kedai di Bussorah Street pada bulan Oktober 1993.\nLegasi nasi padang: Sabar Menanti\nMeneruskan legasi salah satu restoran nasi padang yang paling terkenal di Singapura, restoran ini diasaskan sebagai Sabar Menanti II pada tahun 1997 oleh Maryulis Bagindor binte Marlian, puteri sulung pengasas asal restoran, Haji Marlian bin Athar dan Hajjah Rosemah binte Mailu.\nSabar Menanti, nama asal, bermula sebagai gerai jalanan yang tidak disebutkan namanya pada tahun 1920-an. Dulunya dikenali sebagai nasi padang batu nisan kerana terletak di sebelah pembuat batu nisan yang terkenal. Nama Sabar Menanti, yang bermaksud \"sabar menunggu\" dalam bahasa Melayu, hanya muncul pada tahun 1960-an semasa rakan Haji Marlian memberinya papan tanda dari restoran sebelum itu.\nPada masa usia mudanya, Maryulis dan adik-beradiknya mengumpulkan kayu bakar untuk dapur dan mengambil air dari bekalan air paip awam berhampiran Sultan Gate semasa ibu bapa mereka sedang memasak. Pada tahun 1990-an, perniagaan telah berkembang dengan pembukaan enam restoran di Kampong Gelam, masing-masing dikendalikan oleh anggota generasi kedua keluarga Marlian.\nBerbangga dapat mengekalkan rasa tradisional, masakan Sabar Menanti memaparkan warisan Minangkabau melalui teknik seperti bara arang dan penggunaan rempah dan bahan tradisional. Kaedah ini jelas terdapat pada rendang dan kegemaran lain termasuk ikan bakar dan ayam gulai (kari ayam gaya Padang).\nHari ini, Sabar Menanti mengekalkan warisannya, walaupun restoran itu berusaha menarik minat pelanggan generasi baru. Apabila anak Maryulis, Mohamad Iszahar Tambunan mengambil alih, beliau menamakan semula restoran itu untuk menggambarkan bahawa itu adalah Sabar Menanti tunggal yang beroperasi, dan telah memperbarui hiasan restoran dan menambahkan pilihan penghantaran makanan. Sementara itu, anggota keluarga yang lain terus menggunakan teknik memasak tradisional dan resipi untuk hidangan nasi padang restoran.\nGambar pada tahun 1966 ini menunjukkan keluarga di sebalik Sabar Menanti yang asal. Pengasas bersama perniagaan, Rosemah Mailu, duduk ketiga dari kiri.\n\n\n\n\nRumah barang-barang kecil: Sin Hin Chuan Kee\nPemilik-pemilik Sin Hin Chuan Kee sering menggambarkan perniagaan mereka  berkembang bersama generasi pelanggannya. Ditubuhkan pada tahun 1965 oleh Ng Koon Teng, seorang pendatang dari Quanzhou, China, perniagaan keluarga barang-barang peralatan jahitan berkembang pesat sebahagiannya kerana peluang import dan eksport yang dinikmati oleh Singapura sebagai pusat perdagangan.\nSetelah bekerja di sebuah firma perdagangan, Ng menubuhkan Sin Hin Chuan Kee Trading Co di sebuah kedai di 47 Clyde Street, dengan susur galur keluarganya diserlahkan dalam nama \"Chuan Kee\", yang diterjemahkan menjadi \"mengingat Quan (zhou)\" di Hokkien. Dengan memanfaatkan kedudukan Singapura sebagai pusat perdagangan dan perdagangan, Ng menjual benang, renda, kancing dan berbagai jenis aksesori ke kilang, tukang jahit dan para peniaga. Semasa Clyde Street menjalani pembangunan semula pada tahun 1970-an, kedai itu berpindah ke Kampong Gelam.\nMempamerkan semangat keusahawanan, Ng dan keluarganya mencari pembekal di seluruh Asia pada tahun 1960-an dan 1970-an, dan memperoleh produk seperti benang jahit Flying Wheel dari China dan kemudian zip YKK dari Jepun, yang keduanya menjadi tonggak  perniagaan pengedaran mereka. Pengganti Ng, termasuk anak lelaki Ng Cheow Poh, Ng Cheow Kok dan adik beradik mereka mengembangkan perniagaan dengan mencari pelanggan baru di India, Thailand, Malaysia dan negara lain.\nSemasa ledakan ekonomi pada tahun 1970-an dan 1980-an, para pedagang dari berbagai negara dapat dilihat beratur di luar kedai dan membayar secara tunai untuk pesanan besar zip YKK dan aksesori lain. Kakitangan kedai kemudian akan mengangkut barang ke Boat Quay untuk dihantar ke seluruh dunia, atau dihantar ke pembeli di berbagai lokasi.\nMulai tahun 2000-an, generasi ketiga keluarga Ng, termasuk cucu pengasas Adrian Ng dan Kenny Ng, mengembangkan cabang perniagaan runcit mereka dan memperkenalkan perniagaan dalam talian. Penyesuaian ini antara lain telah membantu mengekalkan Sin Hin Chuan Kee dan memastikan perniagaan itu terus relevan dengan generasi pelanggan baru.\nGambar Ng Koon Teng (kiri), pengasas perniagaan, di kedai pertama Sin Hin Chuan Kee di 47 Clyde Street.\nDari Kampong Gelam hingga Mengerjakan Haji: V. S. S. Varusai Mohamed & Sons\nSejak tahun 1935, V. S. S. Varusai Mohamed & Sons telah menyediakan beratus-ratus ribu umat Islam aksesori yang berguna untuk menunaikan haji. Perniagaan ini diasaskan oleh Valanadu Sinnagani Syeda Mohamed Varusai Mohamed, seorang pendatang kelahiran Tiruchirappalli, India yang tiba di Singapura dari Rangoon, Myanmar.\nVarusai Mohamed memulakan kerjaya keusahawanannya dengan menjual sarung kaki di Kampong Gelam, sebelum mendirikan kilang di kawasan Crawford Court yang berdekatan untuk mengeluarkan dan menjual batang bagasi dan payung keluli. Produk yang terkenal dengan perniagaannya, bagaimanapun, adalah tali pinggang praktikal yang kukuh yang digunakan oleh jemaah haji, yang dikenali sebagai tali pinggang haji atau pangilan mudahnya tali pinggang hijau.\nSemasa menunaikan haji, jemaah haji memakai jubah tanpa jahitan dan tidak berkelim yang dikenali sebagai ihram, sebagai lambang kesamarataan semua umat Islam di hadapan Tuhan. Semasa beliau mengerjakan haji, Varusai Mohamed melihat ramai jemaah mengikat dompet dan barang-barang lain ke ihram mereka secara sementara, dan mendorong beliau untuk mencipta-reka tali pinggang yang boleh menyimpan wang dan barang keperluan.\nPada tahun 1935, Varusai Mohamed mempatenkan Tali Pingang Zam Zam Makkah di United Kingdom dan meneruskan pembuatan tali pinggang di Singapura dengan menggunakan komponen berkualiti. Pada puncaknya, sekitar 60,000 tali pinggang dieksport ke Timur Tengah setiap tahun. Pelanggan Varusai Mohamed untuk tali pinggang dan aksesori Haji yang lain termasuk jemaah dari Singapura, Malaysia dan Indonesia, yang berhenti di kawasan Kampong Gelam dalam perjalanan pergi-balik Haji.\nGenerasi kedua dan ketiga dari perniagaan yang dikendalikan keluarga ini terus kekal menjalankan perniagaan di Kampong Gelam, dan telah memperluas rangkaian barang yang tersedia untuk merangkumi pakaian ihram, setanggi dan minyak wangi antara lain. Setanggi dan minyak wangi, khususnya telah membantu Varusai Mohamed menarik pangkalan pelanggan berbagai budaya.\nIni adalah gambar Valanadu Sinnagani Syeda Mohamed Varusai Mohamed, pengasas perniagaan. Berasal dari Tiruchirappalli di India, dia tiba di Singapura pada tahun 1924.\nTradisi rempah dan arang: Warong Nasi Pariaman\nTradisi Minangkabau adat merantau, atau penghijrahan, telah dikaitkan dengan populariti rendang daging lembu di seluruh Indonesia, Singapura dan Malaysia. Hidangan yang dimasak dengan perlahan dan berperisa bagaikan pengubat rindu kampung halaman bagi para pendatang Minangkabau, rendang dan hidangan nasi padang lain telah menjadi makanan utama di Warong Nasi Pariaman selama beberapa dekad.\nDitubuhkan oleh Isrin bin Ibrahim dan isterinya Rosna binte Zainal Abidin, Warong Nasi Pariaman telah menyediakan nasi padang (juga dikenali sebagai masakan Minang) dari kedai North Bridge Road ini sejak tahun 1948. Setelah berhijrah ke Singapura pada tahun 1940-an, Isrin dan keluarganya beroperasi dari sebuah gerai jalan sebelum menyewa rumah kedai dan menamakan perniagaan mereka sempena nama kampung halaman mereka di Pariaman, sebuah kota di Sumatera Barat, Indonesia.\nKetekunan Isrin sebagai ketua keluarga yang mengutamakan bahan-bahan berkualiti, kaedah memasak dan hiasan sajian terus membawa masakan Warong Nasi Pariaman pada abad ke-21.

Introduction\nAbout the Street Corner Heritage Galleries scheme\nThe Street Corner Heritage Galleries scheme is a collaborative effort between NHB museums, heritage institutions and community galleries, and local shop owners in their respective precincts to strengthen partnerships with communities and raise awareness of and foster deeper appreciation for heritage in everyday spaces. \nThe scheme allows NHB to work closely with local shop owners with at least 30 years of history in selected precincts to co-create “mini museums” that showcase the history and heritage of their respective businesses and trades. Located on site, these galleries will display historical documents, photographs and artefacts that tell the stories of these shops.\nOn top of providing funding, curatorial support and assistance in fabricating the showcases, NHB will also work with local shop owners to develop programmes such as talks, tours and workshops, and provide opportunities to participate in key NHB events such as the Singapore Heritage Festival and the respective CultureFests of the heritage institutions within their precincts.\n老店铺文化站：甘榜格南\nGaleri Warisan Sudut Jalan: Kampong Gelam\nதெரு முனை மரபுடைமைக் காட்சிக்கூடங்கள் : கம்போங் கிளாம்\nDeep roots of a sweet street favourite: Bhai Sarbat Singapore\nSweet and spiced with ginger, teh sarabat (also known as teh halia) has long been a familiar, simple pleasure to quench one’s thirst on a hot day. Bhai Sarbat has been offering teh sarabat and other local favourites to patrons since the 1950s when the beverage business was started by a migrant from India known colloquially as Firuz.\nFirst operating as a becak (“cycle rickshaw” in Malay) stall, Bhai Sarbat settled into a shophouse in the 1970s. When current owner Mohammad Asgar bought over the business in 2018, he named the shop Bhai Sarbat (“Brother Sarbat” in Hindi and Urdu) after overhearing a customer referring to its colloquial name.\nThe shop’s success is built on the popularity of teh tarik and teh sarabat, both pulled tea drinks with the latter usually including a ginger extract. In Arabic, Persian and Indian cultures, sharbat, from which sarabat is derived, is generally understood to be a sweet, usually syrup-based drink. However, the term was also adopted for pulled ginger tea in Singapore and Malaysia.\nTeh sarabat and teh tarik are made with black tea and condensed milk, and Bhai Sarbat’s tea masters demonstrate their individual flair using different pulling techniques. Pulled between two mugs, the varying techniques and lengths of the pull subtly change the temperature and taste of the tea while producing a frothy top layer.\nTo cater to evolving tastes, Asgar has expanded the drinks menu from 12 to more than 120 drinks, and roped in his son Zaki as a next-generation tea master. Today, a steady flow of new as well as regular customers continues to patronise the shop.\nThis sock is used to filter tea or coffee powder for drinks at Bhai Sarbat, including the famous teh halia and teh tarik.\nAttar through the generations: Jamal Kazura Aromatics\nSince 1933, Jamal Kazura Aromatics has concocted an extensive assortment of perfumes encompassing a diverse variety of scents. The business was founded as Kazura Company by Mohamed Hanifa bin Mohamed Shariff, who had migrated to Singapore from South India via the Riau Islands.\nHanifa’s first shop was located at 728 North Bridge Road, and in the early years, he sold a variety of items, including books, gemstones, apparel and perfumes. Many of his customers were pilgrims on the Haj and congregants at the nearby Masjid Sultan.\nAfter taking over the business in the mid-1970s, the founder’s son Mohamed Jamal bin Mohamed Hanifa renamed the business as Jamal Kazura Aromatics and focused on selling perfumes, essential oils and incense. The business also began specialising in non-alcoholic perfumes known as attar in Arabic. For centuries, attar has been a high-prestige item in Islamic communities worldwide, with some Muslims applying scents on themselves before prayers.\nUsing essential oils such as saffron, sandalwood and frankincense, Jamal blends and creates numerous distinctive perfumes, including the bestsellers “Symphony” and “Sultan”. Jamal’s children, now third-generation managers of the business, recall going to school wearing multifarious scents as their father would test his perfumes on them.\nFrom the 1990s, the business broadened its perfume range to cater to evolving tastes and a multi-ethnic, multi-religious clientele, which includes Buddhists purchasing sandalwood incense and Christians buying frankincense. In 2009, the founder’s grandson Johari Kazura opened Sifr Aromatics at 42 Arab Street, offering more bespoke perfumes and sustaining his family’s heritage of craft and innovation.\nA photograph of Kazura Company’s founder Mohamed Hanifa bin Mohamed Shariff (middle) with two business partners from Switzerland.\nHeritage food, community and custom: Rumah Makan Minang\nEstablished in the early 1980s, Rumah Makan Minang is one of the successors of the original Sabar Menanti restaurant. Growing up and working in the family-run Sabar Menanti stall, owner Zulbaidah binte Marlian had firsthand experience of how her mother Hajjah Rosemah binte Mailu exemplified the independent, strong female figures esteemed in Minangkabau culture. Following in her footsteps, Zulbaidah founded her own nasi padang establishment, Rumah Makan Minang, with her husband Mohamed Zin bin Harun.\nOne of the centrepieces of nasi padang cuisine is beef rendang, a slow-cooked dish of beef, spices and coconut which originated from the Minangkabau people but has also been adapted in other regional cuisines. Rumah Makan Minang’s rendang is faithful to the drier, caramelised style served in Sungai Limau, West Sumatra, where Rosemah was born.\nThe restaurant’s other popular dishes are ayam belado hijau (fried chicken with signature green sambal belado) and paru belado merah (fried cow lung with red sambal belado), whose main ingredients are cooked with sambal belado, a coarse chilli paste that is widely used in Minangkabau cuisine. Another characteristic of Minangkabau cuisine is the use of santan (coconut milk) and fresh grated coconut instead of kerisik (fried coconut paste).\nThe above-mentioned cooking techniques and recipes at Rumah Makan Minang bear the imprint of three generations, from Hajjah Rosemah and Haji Marlian to Zulbaidah and Zin, and their children, Hazmi, Syahidah, Ariff and Nazri. Under their charge, the business opened a central kitchen to ensure the consistency and quality of their food, and added a new branch at Tampines in 2017. Their rendang has also been showcased on Shangri-La Hotel’s heritage menu, even as its recipe remains a family secret.\nThis photograph shows the previous location of Rumah Makan Minang, which occupied three shophouse units on Bussorah Street in October 1993.\nA nasi padang legacy: Sabar Menanti\nContinuing the legacy of one of the most well-known nasi padang restaurants in Singapore, this restaurant was founded as Sabar Menanti II in 1997 by Maryulis Bagindor binte Marlian, the eldest daughter of the original restaurant’s founders Haji Marlian bin Athar and Hajjah Rosemah binte Mailu.\nSabar Menanti, the original establishment, started as an unnamed street stall in the 1920s. It was once colloquially known as nasi padang batu nisan (“tombstone nasi padang” in Malay) as it was located next to a prominent tombstone maker. The name Sabar Menanti, which means “wait patiently” in Malay, only came about in the 1960s when Haji Marlian’s friend gifted him a signboard from a previous restaurant.\nIn her younger days, Maryulis and her siblings would gather firewood for the stoves and collect water from a public standpipe near Sultan Gate while their parents cooked. By the 1990s, the business had expanded into six restaurants in Kampong Gelam, each helmed by second generation members of the Marlian family.\nPriding itself on preserving traditional flavours, Sabar Menanti’s cuisine expresses its Minangkabau heritage through techniques such as charcoal grilling and the use of traditional spices and ingredients. These methods are apparent in their rendang and other favourites including ikan bakar (grilled fish) and ayam gulai (Padang-style chicken curry).\nToday, Sabar Menanti remains true to its heritage, even as the restaurant seeks to appeal to a new generation of customers. When Maryulis' son Mohamad Iszahar Tambunan took over, he renamed the restaurant to reflect that it is the sole Sabar Menanti in operation, and has updated the restaurant's decor and added food delivery options. The other members of the family, meanwhile, continue to use traditional cooking techniques and recipes for the restaurant’s array of nasi padang dishes.\nThis photograph from 1966 shows the family behind the original Sabar Menanti. The business’ co-founder, Rosemah Mailu, is seated third from left.\nThe house of small things: Sin Hin Chuan Kee\nSin Hin Chuan Kee’s proprietors often describe the business as having grown together with generations of its customers. Founded in 1965 by Ng Koon Teng, an immigrant from Quanzhou, China, this family-run haberdashery and trading business boomed in part due to the import and export opportunities that Singapore enjoyed as a trading hub.\nAfter working in a trading firm, Ng established Sin Hin Chuan Kee Trading Co in a shop at 47 Clyde Street, with his family roots reflected in the name “Chuan Kee”, which translates to “remembering Quan(zhou)” in Hokkien. Capitalising on Singapore’s position as an entrepot and trading hub, Ng sold thread, lace, buttons and assorted accessories to factories, tailors and traders. When Clyde Street underwent redevelopment in the 1970s, the shop relocated to Kampong Gelam.\nDisplaying an entrepreneurial zeal, Ng and his family sought out suppliers throughout Asia in the 1960s and 1970s, and sourced for products such as Flying Wheel sewing thread from China and later YKK zippers from Japan, both of which became cornerstones of their distribution business. Ng’s successors, including sons Ng Cheow Kok, Ng Cheow Poh and their siblings expanded the business by finding new customers in India, Thailand, Malaysia and other countries.\nDuring the economic boom in the 1970s and 1980s, traders from various countries could be seen queuing up outside the shop and paying cash for large orders of YKK zippers and other accessories. The shop’s staff would then transport the goods to Boat Quay to be shipped across the world, or delivered to the buyers at various locations.\nFrom the 2000s, the third generation of the Ng family, including the founder’s grandsons Adrian Ng and Kenny Ng, grew the retail arm of their business and established an online storefront. These adaptations, among others, have helped sustain Sin Hin Chuan Kee and keep the business relevant to a new generation of customers.\nA photograph of Ng Koon Teng (left), the business’ founder, in Sin Hin Chuan Kee’s first shop at 47 Clyde Street.\nFrom Kampong Gelam to the Haj: V. S. S. Varusai Mohamed & Sons\nSince 1935, V. S. S. Varusai Mohamed & Sons has provided hundreds of thousands of Muslims with accessories that are useful for the Haj pilgrimage. The business was founded by Valanadu Sinnagani Syeda Mohamed Varusai Mohamed, a Tiruchirappalli, India-born migrant who arrived in Singapore from Rangoon, Myanmar.\nVarusai Mohamed started his entrepreneurial career selling socks in Kampong Gelam, before setting up a factory at the nearby Crawford Court area to manufacture and sell steel baggage trunks and umbrellas. The product that the business is best known for, however, is a sturdy, practical belt used by Haj travellers, known colloquially in Malay as tali pinggang haji or simply as a green belt.\nWhile on the Haj, pilgrims wear unstitched and seamless robes known as ihram, which are meant to signify the equality of all Muslims before God. During his own Haj journey, Varusai Mohamed noticed that many pilgrims were tying their money pouches and other possessions to their ihram using makeshift methods, and he was inspired to design a belt to carry money and necessities.\nIn 1935, Varusai Mohamed patented the Makkah Zam Zam Belt in the United Kingdom and proceeded to manufacture the belt in Singapore using quality components. At its peak, some 60,000 belts were exported to the Middle East each year. Varusai Mohamed’s customers for the belts and other Haj accessories included pilgrims from Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, who made a stop at the Kampong Gelam area on their way to and from the Haj.\nThe second and third generations of this family-run business maintained its longstanding presence in Kampong Gelam, and have expanded the range of goods available to include ihram clothing, incense and perfumes among others. The latter two products in particular have helped Varusai Mohamed attract a multi-cultural customer base.\nThis is a photograph of Valanadu Sinnagani Syeda Mohamed Varusai Mohamed, the founder of the business. Hailing from Tiruchirappalli in India, he arrived in Singapore in 1924.\nA tradition of charcoal and spices: Warong Nasi Pariaman\nThe Minangkabau tradition of merantau, or customary migration, has been linked to the widespread popularity of beef rendang throughout Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia. A flavourful, slow-cooked dish that serves as a reminder of home for the Minangkabau migrants, rendang and other nasi padang favourites have been mainstays here at Warong Nasi Pariaman for decades.\nEstablished by Isrin bin Ibrahim and his wife Rosna binte Zainal Abidin, Warong Nasi Pariaman has been serving nasi padang (also known as Minang cuisine) from this North Bridge Road shop since 1948. Having migrated to Singapore in the 1940s, Isrin and his family operated from a street stall before renting a shophouse and naming their business after their hometown of Pariaman, a city in West Sumatra, Indonesia.\nThe patriarch Isrin’s insistence on quality ingredients, cooking methods and presentation continues to guide Warong Nasi Pariaman’s cuisine in the 21st century. Under the charge of the founder’s children Sudirman, Jumrin, Munaf and Nasrin, the restaurant specialises in nasi padang dishes including beef rendang (beef stew), ayam bakar (grilled chicken) and gulai nangka (jackfruit curry).\nThe rendang and ayam bakar here reflect the traditional cooking techniques of Minangkabau culture, with the former slow-cooked over a charcoal fire, in a stew that includes rempah (spice paste), coconut milk, onions, lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves. The latter dish, ayam bakar, is cooked in a coconut gravy before being charcoal grilled, and both dishes possess a subtle smoky flavour that many customers love.\nIn the 21st century, Isrin’s granddaughter Yanty Sulastry Emrin represents the third generation of the family working in the business. Together with other longstanding nasi padang establishments in Kampong Gelam, Warong Nasi Pariaman continues to keep Minangkabau culinary traditions alive in the area.\nThis photograph shows a pushcart used in the 1980s when rendang and other nasi padang dishes were cooked at the family home at the nearby Bussorah Street, before being transported to the shop.\nGameOn Nila Jejak Warisan Edition\nGameOn Nila Jejak Warisan Edition\nClick here to download the app.", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/street-corner-heritage-galleries-kampong-gelam", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/Street-Corner-Heritage-Galleries-Kampong-Gelam/Bhai-Sarbat-Singapore.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:46"},

Introduction\nMengenai skim Galeri Warisan Sudut Jalan\nSkim Galeri Warisan Sudut Jalan adalah usaha kolaborasi antara muzium NHB, institusi warisan dan galeri komuniti sertapemilik kedai tempatan di kawasan masing-masing untuk memperkukuhkan perkongsian dengan komuniti dan meningkatkan kesedaran dan memupuk penghargaan yang lebih mendalam terhadap warisan di ruang sehari-hari.\nSkim ini membolehkan NHB bekerjasama dengan pemilik kedai tempatan dengan sejarah sekurang-kurangnya 30 tahun di kawasan terpilih untuk bersama-sama membuat \"muzium mini\" yang memaparkan sejarah dan warisan perniagaan dan perdagangan masing-masing. Galeri yang terletak di kedai-kedai ini akan memaparkan dokumen sejarah, gambar dan artefak yang menceritakan kisah- kisah mereka.\nSelain menyediakan dana, sokongan kuratorial dan bantuan dalam membuat pameran, NHB juga akan bekerjasama dengan pemilik kedai tempatan untuk mengembangkan program seperti ceramah, lawatan dan bengkel, dan memberi peluang untuk mengambil bahagian dalam acara penting NHB seperti Pesta Warisan Singapura dan Pesta Budaya oleh institusi warisan masing-masing di kawasan mereka.\nStreet Corner Heritage Galleries: Kampong Gelam\n老店铺文化站：甘榜格南\nதெரு முனை மரபுடைமைக் காட்சிக்கூடங்கள் : கம்போங் கிளாம்\nAkar umbi manisan kegemaran jalanan: Bhai Sarbat Singapura\nManis dan diperisakan dengan halia, sarabat (juga dikenali sebagai teh halia) telah lama menjadi kegemaran lumrah untuk menghilangkan dahaga pada hari yang panas. Bhai Sarbat telah menjual sarabat dan kegemaran tempatan lainnya kepada pelanggan sejak tahun 1950-an semasa perniagaan minuman dimulakan oleh seorang pendatang dari India yang dikenali sebagai Firuz.\nPertama kali berniaga sebagai gerai beca, Bhai Sarbat akhirnya beroperasi di sebuah rumah kedai pada tahun 1970-an. Semasa pemilik sekarang Mohammad Asgar membeli perniagaan tersebut pada tahun 2018, dia menamakan kedai itu Bhai Sarbat (\"Saudara Sarbat\" dalam bahasa Hindi dan Urdu) setelah mendengar pelanggan merujuk kepada nama julukannya.\nKejayaan kedai ini dibina berdasarkan populariti teh sarbat dan teh tarik biasa, teh sarbat adalah campuran teh dan pati halia. Dalam budaya Arab, Parsi dan India, sharbat, dari mana sarabat berasal, umumnya difahami sebagai minuman manis, biasanya berasaskan sirap. Namun, istilah ini juga digunakan untuk teh halia yang ditarik di Singapura dan Malaysia.\nTeh sarabat dan teh tarik dibuat dengan teh hitam dan susu pekat, dan pakar pembuat teh Bhai Sarbat menunjukkan bakat masing-masing menggunakan teknik yang berbeza. Ditarik di antara dua koleh, teknik dan panjang tarikan yang berbeza-beza secara halus mengubah suhu dan rasa teh sambil menghasilkan lapisan atas yang berbuih.\nUntuk memenuhi selera yang sentiasa berubah-rubah, Asgar telah memperluas menu minuman dari 12 hingga lebih dari 120 minuman, dan mejadikan anaknya Zaki sebagai pakar teh generasi seterusnya. Hari ini, aliran pelanggan baru dan tetap berterusan mengunjungi kedai itu.\nPenapis teh kain nilon digunakan untuk menyaring teh atau serbuk kopi untuk minuman di Bhai Sarbat, termasuk teh halia dan teh tarik yang terkenal.\nAttar turun temurun: Aromatik Jamal Kazura\nSejak tahun 1933, Jamal Kazura Aromatics telah membuat banyak jenis minyak wangi yang merangkumi berbagai aroma. Perniagaan ini diasaskan sebagai Syarikat Kazura oleh Mohamed Hanifa bin Mohamed Shariff, yang telah berhijrah ke Singapura dari India Selatan melalui Kepulauan Riau.\nKedai pertama Hanifa terletak di 728 North Bridge Road, dan pada tahun-tahun awalnya, dia menjual berbagai barang, termasuk buku, batu permata, pakaian dan minyak wangi. Ramai pelanggannya bakal jemaah haji dan berhimpun di Masjid Sultan yang berdekatan.\nSetelah mengambil alih perniagaan ini pada pertengahan tahun 1970-an, anak pengasasnya Mohamed Jamal bin Mohamed Hanifa menamakan semula perniagaan itu sebagai Jamal Kazura Aromatics dan memberi tumpuan kepada penjualan minyak wangi, minyak pati dan setanggi. Perniagaan kemudian mengkhususkan penjualan minyak wangi tanpa alkohol yang dikenali sebagai attar dalam bahasa Arab. Berabad-abad lamanya, attar mempunyai kedudukan tinggi dalam masyarakat Islam di seluruh dunia, dengan sebilangan umat Islam memakai wangian pada diri mereka sebelum solat.\nDengan menggunakan minyak pati seperti safron, cendana dan setanggi, Jamal mengadun dan mencipta sebilangan minyak wangi khas, termasuk yang paling laris \"Symphony\" dan \"Sultan\". Anak-anak Jamal, yang kini merupakan pengurus generasi ketiga perniagaan, masih ingat mereka pergi ke sekolah dengan wangian berbagai aroma kerana bapa mereka akan menguji minyak wangi ke atas mereka.\nMulai tahun 1990-an, perniagaan itu memperluaskan rangkaian jenis-jenis minyak wangi untuk memenuhi selera yang sentiasa berkembang dan pelanggan-pelanggan dari  berbagai etnik, agama, termasuk penganut Buddha membeli dupa cendana dan orang Kristian membeli setanggi. Pada tahun 2009, cucu pengasas Johari Kazura membuka Sifr Aromatics di 42 Arab Street, menawarkan lebih banyak rangkaian minyak wangi khusus dan mengekalkan seni warisan dan inovasi keluarganya.\nGambar pengasas Syarikat Kazura, Mohamed Hanifa bin Mohamed Shariff (tengah) bersama dua rakan perniagaan dari Switzerland.\nMakanan warisan, masyarakat dan adat: Rumah Makan Minang\nDidirikan pada awal 1980-an, Rumah Makan Minang adalah salah satu pewaris restoran Sabar Menanti yang asal. Membesar dan bekerja di gerai Sabar Menanti yang dikendalikan oleh keluarga, pemilik Zulbaidah binte Marlian mempunyai pengalaman langsung tentang bagaimana ibunya Hajjah Rosemah binte Mailu, contoh berdikari, tokoh wanita yang dihormati dalam budaya Minangkabau. Mengikuti jejak ibunya, Zulbaidah mengasaskan rumah nasi padang sendiri, iaitu Rumah Makan Minang, bersama suaminya Mohamed Zin bin Harun.\nSalah satu sajian utama nasi padang adalah rendang iaitu masakan daging lembu, rempah dan kelapa yang direnih lama yang berasal dari orang Minangkabau tetapi juga telah disesuaikan dengan masakan dari daerah lain. Rendang Rumah Makan Minang mengekalkan gaya masakan lebih kering dan gelap disajikan di Sungai Limau, Sumatera Barat, tempat Rosemah dilahirkan.\nHidangan popular lain di restoran itu adalah ayam belado hijau (ayam goreng dengan sambal belado hijau khas) dan paru belado merah (paru-paru lembu goreng dengan sambal belado merah), yang bahan utamanya dimasak dengan sambal belado, bumbu cili kasar yang banyak digunakan dalam masakan Minangkabau. Ciri khas masakan Minangkabau adalah penggunaan santan dan kelapa parut segar dan bukannya kerisik.\nTeknik memasak dan resipi Rumah Makan Minang yang disebutkan di atas, membawa pengalaman turun temurun tiga generasi, dari Hajjah Rosemah dan Haji Marlian hingga Zulbaidah dan Zin, dan anak-anak mereka, Hazmi, Syahidah, Ariff dan Nazri. Di bawah pengurusan mereka, perniagaan itu membuka dapur pusat untuk memastikan keselarasan dan mutu  makanan mereka, dan menambahkan cabang baru di Tampines pada tahun 2017. Rendang mereka juga telah dipamerkan di menu warisan Shangri-La Hotel, meskipun resipinya tetap menjadi rahsia keluarga.\nGambar ini menunjukkan lokasi Rumah Makan Minang sebelumnya, yang menduduki tiga unit rumah kedai di Bussorah Street pada bulan Oktober 1993.\nLegasi nasi padang: Sabar Menanti\nMeneruskan legasi salah satu restoran nasi padang yang paling terkenal di Singapura, restoran ini diasaskan sebagai Sabar Menanti II pada tahun 1997 oleh Maryulis Bagindor binte Marlian, puteri sulung pengasas asal restoran, Haji Marlian bin Athar dan Hajjah Rosemah binte Mailu.\nSabar Menanti, nama asal, bermula sebagai gerai jalanan yang tidak disebutkan namanya pada tahun 1920-an. Dulunya dikenali sebagai nasi padang batu nisan kerana terletak di sebelah pembuat batu nisan yang terkenal. Nama Sabar Menanti, yang bermaksud \"sabar menunggu\" dalam bahasa Melayu, hanya muncul pada tahun 1960-an semasa rakan Haji Marlian memberinya papan tanda dari restoran sebelum itu.\nPada masa usia mudanya, Maryulis dan adik-beradiknya mengumpulkan kayu bakar untuk dapur dan mengambil air dari bekalan air paip awam berhampiran Sultan Gate semasa ibu bapa mereka sedang memasak. Pada tahun 1990-an, perniagaan telah berkembang dengan pembukaan enam restoran di Kampong Gelam, masing-masing dikendalikan oleh anggota generasi kedua keluarga Marlian.\nBerbangga dapat mengekalkan rasa tradisional, masakan Sabar Menanti memaparkan warisan Minangkabau melalui teknik seperti bara arang dan penggunaan rempah dan bahan tradisional. Kaedah ini jelas terdapat pada rendang dan kegemaran lain termasuk ikan bakar dan ayam gulai (kari ayam gaya Padang).\nHari ini, Sabar Menanti mengekalkan warisannya, walaupun restoran itu berusaha menarik minat pelanggan generasi baru. Apabila anak Maryulis, Mohamad Iszahar Tambunan mengambil alih, beliau menamakan semula restoran itu untuk menggambarkan bahawa itu adalah Sabar Menanti tunggal yang beroperasi, dan telah memperbarui hiasan restoran dan menambahkan pilihan penghantaran makanan. Sementara itu, anggota keluarga yang lain terus menggunakan teknik memasak tradisional dan resipi untuk hidangan nasi padang restoran.\nGambar pada tahun 1966 ini menunjukkan keluarga di sebalik Sabar Menanti yang asal. Pengasas bersama perniagaan, Rosemah Mailu, duduk ketiga dari kiri.\n\n\n\n\nRumah barang-barang kecil: Sin Hin Chuan Kee\nPemilik-pemilik Sin Hin Chuan Kee sering menggambarkan perniagaan mereka  berkembang bersama generasi pelanggannya. Ditubuhkan pada tahun 1965 oleh Ng Koon Teng, seorang pendatang dari Quanzhou, China, perniagaan keluarga barang-barang peralatan jahitan berkembang pesat sebahagiannya kerana peluang import dan eksport yang dinikmati oleh Singapura sebagai pusat perdagangan.\nSetelah bekerja di sebuah firma perdagangan, Ng menubuhkan Sin Hin Chuan Kee Trading Co di sebuah kedai di 47 Clyde Street, dengan susur galur keluarganya diserlahkan dalam nama \"Chuan Kee\", yang diterjemahkan menjadi \"mengingat Quan (zhou)\" di Hokkien. Dengan memanfaatkan kedudukan Singapura sebagai pusat perdagangan dan perdagangan, Ng menjual benang, renda, kancing dan berbagai jenis aksesori ke kilang, tukang jahit dan para peniaga. Semasa Clyde Street menjalani pembangunan semula pada tahun 1970-an, kedai itu berpindah ke Kampong Gelam.\nMempamerkan semangat keusahawanan, Ng dan keluarganya mencari pembekal di seluruh Asia pada tahun 1960-an dan 1970-an, dan memperoleh produk seperti benang jahit Flying Wheel dari China dan kemudian zip YKK dari Jepun, yang keduanya menjadi tonggak  perniagaan pengedaran mereka. Pengganti Ng, termasuk anak lelaki Ng Cheow Poh, Ng Cheow Kok dan adik beradik mereka mengembangkan perniagaan dengan mencari pelanggan baru di India, Thailand, Malaysia dan negara lain.\nSemasa ledakan ekonomi pada tahun 1970-an dan 1980-an, para pedagang dari berbagai negara dapat dilihat beratur di luar kedai dan membayar secara tunai untuk pesanan besar zip YKK dan aksesori lain. Kakitangan kedai kemudian akan mengangkut barang ke Boat Quay untuk dihantar ke seluruh dunia, atau dihantar ke pembeli di berbagai lokasi.\nMulai tahun 2000-an, generasi ketiga keluarga Ng, termasuk cucu pengasas Adrian Ng dan Kenny Ng, mengembangkan cabang perniagaan runcit mereka dan memperkenalkan perniagaan dalam talian. Penyesuaian ini antara lain telah membantu mengekalkan Sin Hin Chuan Kee dan memastikan perniagaan itu terus relevan dengan generasi pelanggan baru.\nGambar Ng Koon Teng (kiri), pengasas perniagaan, di kedai pertama Sin Hin Chuan Kee di 47 Clyde Street.\nDari Kampong Gelam hingga Mengerjakan Haji: V. S. S. Varusai Mohamed & Sons\nSejak tahun 1935, V. S. S. Varusai Mohamed & Sons telah menyediakan beratus-ratus ribu umat Islam aksesori yang berguna untuk menunaikan haji. Perniagaan ini diasaskan oleh Valanadu Sinnagani Syeda Mohamed Varusai Mohamed, seorang pendatang kelahiran Tiruchirappalli, India yang tiba di Singapura dari Rangoon, Myanmar.\nVarusai Mohamed memulakan kerjaya keusahawanannya dengan menjual sarung kaki di Kampong Gelam, sebelum mendirikan kilang di kawasan Crawford Court yang berdekatan untuk mengeluarkan dan menjual batang bagasi dan payung keluli. Produk yang terkenal dengan perniagaannya, bagaimanapun, adalah tali pinggang praktikal yang kukuh yang digunakan oleh jemaah haji, yang dikenali sebagai tali pinggang haji atau pangilan mudahnya tali pinggang hijau.\nSemasa menunaikan haji, jemaah haji memakai jubah tanpa jahitan dan tidak berkelim yang dikenali sebagai ihram, sebagai lambang kesamarataan semua umat Islam di hadapan Tuhan. Semasa beliau mengerjakan haji, Varusai Mohamed melihat ramai jemaah mengikat dompet dan barang-barang lain ke ihram mereka secara sementara, dan mendorong beliau untuk mencipta-reka tali pinggang yang boleh menyimpan wang dan barang keperluan.\nPada tahun 1935, Varusai Mohamed mempatenkan Tali Pingang Zam Zam Makkah di United Kingdom dan meneruskan pembuatan tali pinggang di Singapura dengan menggunakan komponen berkualiti. Pada puncaknya, sekitar 60,000 tali pinggang dieksport ke Timur Tengah setiap tahun. Pelanggan Varusai Mohamed untuk tali pinggang dan aksesori Haji yang lain termasuk jemaah dari Singapura, Malaysia dan Indonesia, yang berhenti di kawasan Kampong Gelam dalam perjalanan pergi-balik Haji.\nGenerasi kedua dan ketiga dari perniagaan yang dikendalikan keluarga ini terus kekal menjalankan perniagaan di Kampong Gelam, dan telah memperluas rangkaian barang yang tersedia untuk merangkumi pakaian ihram, setanggi dan minyak wangi antara lain. Setanggi dan minyak wangi, khususnya telah membantu Varusai Mohamed menarik pangkalan pelanggan berbagai budaya.\nIni adalah gambar Valanadu Sinnagani Syeda Mohamed Varusai Mohamed, pengasas perniagaan. Berasal dari Tiruchirappalli di India, dia tiba di Singapura pada tahun 1924.\nTradisi rempah dan arang: Warong Nasi Pariaman\nTradisi Minangkabau adat merantau, atau penghijrahan, telah dikaitkan dengan populariti rendang daging lembu di seluruh Indonesia, Singapura dan Malaysia.

Setelah berhijrah ke Singapura pada tahun 1940-an, Isrin dan keluarganya beroperasi dari sebuah gerai jalan sebelum menyewa rumah kedai dan menamakan perniagaan mereka sempena nama kampung halaman mereka di Pariaman, sebuah kota di Sumatera Barat, Indonesia.\nKetekunan Isrin sebagai ketua keluarga yang mengutamakan bahan-bahan berkualiti, kaedah memasak dan hiasan sajian terus membawa masakan Warong Nasi Pariaman pada abad ke-21.

Introduction\nAbout the Street Corner Heritage Galleries scheme\nThe Street Corner Heritage Galleries scheme is a collaborative effort between NHB museums, heritage institutions and community galleries, and local shop owners in their respective precincts to strengthen partnerships with communities and raise awareness of and foster deeper appreciation for heritage in everyday spaces. \nThe scheme allows NHB to work closely with local shop owners with at least 30 years of history in selected precincts to co-create “mini museums” that showcase the history and heritage of their respective businesses and trades. Located on site, these galleries will display historical documents, photographs and artefacts that tell the stories of these shops.\nOn top of providing funding, curatorial support and assistance in fabricating the showcases, NHB will also work with local shop owners to develop programmes such as talks, tours and workshops, and provide opportunities to participate in key NHB events such as the Singapore Heritage Festival and the respective CultureFests of the heritage institutions within their precincts.\n老店铺文化站：甘榜格南\nGaleri Warisan Sudut Jalan: Kampong Gelam\nதெரு முனை மரபுடைமைக் காட்சிக்கூடங்கள் : கம்போங் கிளாம்\nDeep roots of a sweet street favourite: Bhai Sarbat Singapore\nSweet and spiced with ginger, teh sarabat (also known as teh halia) has long been a familiar, simple pleasure to quench one’s thirst on a hot day. Bhai Sarbat has been offering teh sarabat and other local favourites to patrons since the 1950s when the beverage business was started by a migrant from India known colloquially as Firuz.\nFirst operating as a becak (“cycle rickshaw” in Malay) stall, Bhai Sarbat settled into a shophouse in the 1970s. When current owner Mohammad Asgar bought over the business in 2018, he named the shop Bhai Sarbat (“Brother Sarbat” in Hindi and Urdu) after overhearing a customer referring to its colloquial name.\nThe shop’s success is built on the popularity of teh tarik and teh sarabat, both pulled tea drinks with the latter usually including a ginger extract. In Arabic, Persian and Indian cultures, sharbat, from which sarabat is derived, is generally understood to be a sweet, usually syrup-based drink. However, the term was also adopted for pulled ginger tea in Singapore and Malaysia.\nTeh sarabat and teh tarik are made with black tea and condensed milk, and Bhai Sarbat’s tea masters demonstrate their individual flair using different pulling techniques. Pulled between two mugs, the varying techniques and lengths of the pull subtly change the temperature and taste of the tea while producing a frothy top layer.\nTo cater to evolving tastes, Asgar has expanded the drinks menu from 12 to more than 120 drinks, and roped in his son Zaki as a next-generation tea master. Today, a steady flow of new as well as regular customers continues to patronise the shop.\nThis sock is used to filter tea or coffee powder for drinks at Bhai Sarbat, including the famous teh halia and teh tarik.\nAttar through the generations: Jamal Kazura Aromatics\nSince 1933, Jamal Kazura Aromatics has concocted an extensive assortment of perfumes encompassing a diverse variety of scents. The business was founded as Kazura Company by Mohamed Hanifa bin Mohamed Shariff, who had migrated to Singapore from South India via the Riau Islands.\nHanifa’s first shop was located at 728 North Bridge Road, and in the early years, he sold a variety of items, including books, gemstones, apparel and perfumes. Many of his customers were pilgrims on the Haj and congregants at the nearby Masjid Sultan.\nAfter taking over the business in the mid-1970s, the founder’s son Mohamed Jamal bin Mohamed Hanifa renamed the business as Jamal Kazura Aromatics and focused on selling perfumes, essential oils and incense. The business also began specialising in non-alcoholic perfumes known as attar in Arabic. For centuries, attar has been a high-prestige item in Islamic communities worldwide, with some Muslims applying scents on themselves before prayers.\nUsing essential oils such as saffron, sandalwood and frankincense, Jamal blends and creates numerous distinctive perfumes, including the bestsellers “Symphony” and “Sultan”. Jamal’s children, now third-generation managers of the business, recall going to school wearing multifarious scents as their father would test his perfumes on them.\nFrom the 1990s, the business broadened its perfume range to cater to evolving tastes and a multi-ethnic, multi-religious clientele, which includes Buddhists purchasing sandalwood incense and Christians buying frankincense. In 2009, the founder’s grandson Johari Kazura opened Sifr Aromatics at 42 Arab Street, offering more bespoke perfumes and sustaining his family’s heritage of craft and innovation.\nA photograph of Kazura Company’s founder Mohamed Hanifa bin Mohamed Shariff (middle) with two business partners from Switzerland.\nHeritage food, community and custom: Rumah Makan Minang\nEstablished in the early 1980s, Rumah Makan Minang is one of the successors of the original Sabar Menanti restaurant. Growing up and working in the family-run Sabar Menanti stall, owner Zulbaidah binte Marlian had firsthand experience of how her mother Hajjah Rosemah binte Mailu exemplified the independent, strong female figures esteemed in Minangkabau culture. Following in her footsteps, Zulbaidah founded her own nasi padang establishment, Rumah Makan Minang, with her husband Mohamed Zin bin Harun.\nOne of the centrepieces of nasi padang cuisine is beef rendang, a slow-cooked dish of beef, spices and coconut which originated from the Minangkabau people but has also been adapted in other regional cuisines. Rumah Makan Minang’s rendang is faithful to the drier, caramelised style served in Sungai Limau, West Sumatra, where Rosemah was born.\nThe restaurant’s other popular dishes are ayam belado hijau (fried chicken with signature green sambal belado) and paru belado merah (fried cow lung with red sambal belado), whose main ingredients are cooked with sambal belado, a coarse chilli paste that is widely used in Minangkabau cuisine. Another characteristic of Minangkabau cuisine is the use of santan (coconut milk) and fresh grated coconut instead of kerisik (fried coconut paste).\nThe above-mentioned cooking techniques and recipes at Rumah Makan Minang bear the imprint of three generations, from Hajjah Rosemah and Haji Marlian to Zulbaidah and Zin, and their children, Hazmi, Syahidah, Ariff and Nazri. Under their charge, the business opened a central kitchen to ensure the consistency and quality of their food, and added a new branch at Tampines in 2017. Their rendang has also been showcased on Shangri-La Hotel’s heritage menu, even as its recipe remains a family secret.\nThis photograph shows the previous location of Rumah Makan Minang, which occupied three shophouse units on Bussorah Street in October 1993.\nA nasi padang legacy: Sabar Menanti\nContinuing the legacy of one of the most well-known nasi padang restaurants in Singapore, this restaurant was founded as Sabar Menanti II in 1997 by Maryulis Bagindor binte Marlian, the eldest daughter of the original restaurant’s founders Haji Marlian bin Athar and Hajjah Rosemah binte Mailu.\nSabar Menanti, the original establishment, started as an unnamed street stall in the 1920s. It was once colloquially known as nasi padang batu nisan (“tombstone nasi padang” in Malay) as it was located next to a prominent tombstone maker. The name Sabar Menanti, which means “wait patiently” in Malay, only came about in the 1960s when Haji Marlian’s friend gifted him a signboard from a previous restaurant.\nIn her younger days, Maryulis and her siblings would gather firewood for the stoves and collect water from a public standpipe near Sultan Gate while their parents cooked. By the 1990s, the business had expanded into six restaurants in Kampong Gelam, each helmed by second generation members of the Marlian family.\nPriding itself on preserving traditional flavours, Sabar Menanti’s cuisine expresses its Minangkabau heritage through techniques such as charcoal grilling and the use of traditional spices and ingredients. These methods are apparent in their rendang and other favourites including ikan bakar (grilled fish) and ayam gulai (Padang-style chicken curry).\nToday, Sabar Menanti remains true to its heritage, even as the restaurant seeks to appeal to a new generation of customers. When Maryulis' son Mohamad Iszahar Tambunan took over, he renamed the restaurant to reflect that it is the sole Sabar Menanti in operation, and has updated the restaurant's decor and added food delivery options. The other members of the family, meanwhile, continue to use traditional cooking techniques and recipes for the restaurant’s array of nasi padang dishes.\nThis photograph from 1966 shows the family behind the original Sabar Menanti. The business’ co-founder, Rosemah Mailu, is seated third from left.\nThe house of small things: Sin Hin Chuan Kee\nSin Hin Chuan Kee’s proprietors often describe the business as having grown together with generations of its customers. Founded in 1965 by Ng Koon Teng, an immigrant from Quanzhou, China, this family-run haberdashery and trading business boomed in part due to the import and export opportunities that Singapore enjoyed as a trading hub.\nAfter working in a trading firm, Ng established Sin Hin Chuan Kee Trading Co in a shop at 47 Clyde Street, with his family roots reflected in the name “Chuan Kee”, which translates to “remembering Quan(zhou)” in Hokkien. Capitalising on Singapore’s position as an entrepot and trading hub, Ng sold thread, lace, buttons and assorted accessories to factories, tailors and traders. When Clyde Street underwent redevelopment in the 1970s, the shop relocated to Kampong Gelam.\nDisplaying an entrepreneurial zeal, Ng and his family sought out suppliers throughout Asia in the 1960s and 1970s, and sourced for products such as Flying Wheel sewing thread from China and later YKK zippers from Japan, both of which became cornerstones of their distribution business. Ng’s successors, including sons Ng Cheow Kok, Ng Cheow Poh and their siblings expanded the business by finding new customers in India, Thailand, Malaysia and other countries.\nDuring the economic boom in the 1970s and 1980s, traders from various countries could be seen queuing up outside the shop and paying cash for large orders of YKK zippers and other accessories. The shop’s staff would then transport the goods to Boat Quay to be shipped across the world, or delivered to the buyers at various locations.\nFrom the 2000s, the third generation of the Ng family, including the founder’s grandsons Adrian Ng and Kenny Ng, grew the retail arm of their business and established an online storefront. These adaptations, among others, have helped sustain Sin Hin Chuan Kee and keep the business relevant to a new generation of customers.\nA photograph of Ng Koon Teng (left), the business’ founder, in Sin Hin Chuan Kee’s first shop at 47 Clyde Street.\nFrom Kampong Gelam to the Haj: V. S. S. Varusai Mohamed & Sons\nSince 1935, V. S. S. Varusai Mohamed & Sons has provided hundreds of thousands of Muslims with accessories that are useful for the Haj pilgrimage. The business was founded by Valanadu Sinnagani Syeda Mohamed Varusai Mohamed, a Tiruchirappalli, India-born migrant who arrived in Singapore from Rangoon, Myanmar.\nVarusai Mohamed started his entrepreneurial career selling socks in Kampong Gelam, before setting up a factory at the nearby Crawford Court area to manufacture and sell steel baggage trunks and umbrellas. The product that the business is best known for, however, is a sturdy, practical belt used by Haj travellers, known colloquially in Malay as tali pinggang haji or simply as a green belt.\nWhile on the Haj, pilgrims wear unstitched and seamless robes known as ihram, which are meant to signify the equality of all Muslims before God. During his own Haj journey, Varusai Mohamed noticed that many pilgrims were tying their money pouches and other possessions to their ihram using makeshift methods, and he was inspired to design a belt to carry money and necessities.\nIn 1935, Varusai Mohamed patented the Makkah Zam Zam Belt in the United Kingdom and proceeded to manufacture the belt in Singapore using quality components. At its peak, some 60,000 belts were exported to the Middle East each year. Varusai Mohamed’s customers for the belts and other Haj accessories included pilgrims from Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, who made a stop at the Kampong Gelam area on their way to and from the Haj.\nThe second and third generations of this family-run business maintained its longstanding presence in Kampong Gelam, and have expanded the range of goods available to include ihram clothing, incense and perfumes among others. The latter two products in particular have helped Varusai Mohamed attract a multi-cultural customer base.\nThis is a photograph of Valanadu Sinnagani Syeda Mohamed Varusai Mohamed, the founder of the business. Hailing from Tiruchirappalli in India, he arrived in Singapore in 1924.\nA tradition of charcoal and spices: Warong Nasi Pariaman\nThe Minangkabau tradition of merantau, or customary migration, has been linked to the widespread popularity of beef rendang throughout Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia. A flavourful, slow-cooked dish that serves as a reminder of home for the Minangkabau migrants, rendang and other nasi padang favourites have been mainstays here at Warong Nasi Pariaman for decades.\nEstablished by Isrin bin Ibrahim and his wife Rosna binte Zainal Abidin, Warong Nasi Pariaman has been serving nasi padang (also known as Minang cuisine) from this North Bridge Road shop since 1948. Having migrated to Singapore in the 1940s, Isrin and his family operated from a street stall before renting a shophouse and naming their business after their hometown of Pariaman, a city in West Sumatra, Indonesia.\nThe patriarch Isrin’s insistence on quality ingredients, cooking methods and presentation continues to guide Warong Nasi Pariaman’s cuisine in the 21st century. Under the charge of the founder’s children Sudirman, Jumrin, Munaf and Nasrin, the restaurant specialises in nasi padang dishes including beef rendang (beef stew), ayam bakar (grilled chicken) and gulai nangka (jackfruit curry).\nThe rendang and ayam bakar here reflect the traditional cooking techniques of Minangkabau culture, with the former slow-cooked over a charcoal fire, in a stew that includes rempah (spice paste), coconut milk, onions, lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves. The latter dish, ayam bakar, is cooked in a coconut gravy before being charcoal grilled, and both dishes possess a subtle smoky flavour that many customers love.\nIn the 21st century, Isrin’s granddaughter Yanty Sulastry Emrin represents the third generation of the family working in the business. Together with other longstanding nasi padang establishments in Kampong Gelam, Warong Nasi Pariaman continues to keep Minangkabau culinary traditions alive in the area.\nThis photograph shows a pushcart used in the 1980s when rendang and other nasi padang dishes were cooked at the family home at the nearby Bussorah Street, before being transported to the shop.\nGameOn Nila Jejak Warisan Edition\nGameOn Nila Jejak Warisan Edition\nClick here to download the app.", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/street-corner-heritage-galleries-kampong-gelam", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/Street-Corner-Heritage-Galleries-Kampong-Gelam/Bhai-Sarbat-Singapore.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:46"},

This began to change on 20 October 1958 when businessman Tang Choon Keng opened his signature department store, C K Tang, by the Scotts Road junction of Orchard Road.\nTang had arrived in Singapore in 1923 from Swatow, China, and worked as salesman of fine lace and linen which he brought from his hometown. In 1932, Tang opened his first store at a rented shophouse along River Valley Road. As his business grew, he relocated to a row of seven shophouses at River Valley Road (now Gainurn Building, named after Tang’s father, Tang Gain Urn). After World War II, Tang learnt that some Orchard Road residents were preparing to leave Singapore and decided to buy their land, which was located across from the Teochew cemetery.\nTang felt that Orchard Road was a good business location as residents of Tanglin and Holland Road, as well as people from Johor, would pass by the area on their way downtown. Tang thus commissioned architect Ang Keng Leng to design a five-storey building based on the Imperial Palace in Beijing, China, as he felt that a building with such distinctive features would attract the attention of shoppers. Consequently, the original C K Tang building had a pagoda-like roof with green tiles, which was supported by large red columns.\nAs the first department store along Orchard Road, C K Tang quickly became a landmark shopping destination. The original building was replaced by the larger Tang Plaza in 1982, although some of the distinctive features of the original building such as a green-tiled roof and red colonnades were incorporated into the design of the new plaza. Today, its 33-storey pagoda-like tower and podium house the Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel and Tangs Department Store.\nReturn to Orchard Heritage Trail\nTang Plaza", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/places/places-landing/Places/landmarks/orchard-heritage-trail/tang-plaza", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/landmarks/orchard-heritage-trail/tang_plaza_3.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:46"},

Location\nNational Monuments sksks\n50 Eu Tong Sen Street, Singapore 059803\nGet Directions\nHome to the first free traditional Chinese medical clinic for the poor in Singapore, the Former Thong Chai Medical Institution testifies to the Chinese pioneers’ spirit of mutual assistance and their generosity towards the poor and needy. Apart from being a medical facility, the building also housed various Chinese guilds and served as the headquarters of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce (today’s Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry) when it was first established.\nFoundation of the Medical Institution\nSeven Chinese merchants founded Thong Chai Medical Institution in 1867 in a shophouse on Upper Pickering Street. It was initially called Thong Chai Yee Say (同济医社, ‘Thong Chai Medical Society’). The name ‘Thong Chai’ is derived from the Cantonese pronunciation of two Chinese characters: tong (同, ‘universal’) and ji (济, ‘relief’). They reflect the institution’s objective of providing free diagnosis and herbal medicine to all people, regardless of race, religion, and social status.\nUpon learning about Thong Chai Medical Society’s charitable mission, Governor of the Straits Settlements Sir Cecil Clementi Smith granted the institution the land parcel on which the building now stands. Construction of the new Thong Chai building began in 1891 with funds from public subscriptions and generous donations from individuals. One of the main donors was Gan Eng Seng (颜永成), the Malacca-born Hokkien philanthropist and businessman who was also the trustee of the Thong Chai estate at that time. When the building was completed and officially opened a year later in 1892, Thong Chai Yee Say was renamed Thong Chai Medical Institution (同济医院).\nMeeting Hall\nBesides being a medical facility, the Former Thong Chai Medical Institution also functioned as a venue for guild and political gatherings. In 1906, a group of Chinese merchants founded the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce within the building. The organisation held their meetings in the building until it moved into the former residence of Wee Ah Hood (黄亚佛), a wealthy Teochew merchant, on Hill Street. Presently, the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry building stands in place of the residence.\nNanyang Volunteers\nWhen the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, well known Hokkien businessman and philanthropist Tan Kah Kee (陈嘉庚) – who founded The Chinese High School  – established the China Relief Fund to aid the Chinese war efforts against the Japanese. In 1939, the Committee of the China Relief Fund issued its first recruitment notice in local Chinese newspapers for experienced mechanics and drivers to help transport war supplies to China via the Burma Road. While most of the volunteers, who came to be known as the Nanyang Volunteers, were Chinese men, there were also some Malay and Indian men, and even a few Chinese women. A training centre was set up within the estate of Lian Shan Shuang Lin Monastery. The first batches of the Nanyang Volunteers were housed in Thong Chai Medical Institution, which also became an administration centre for the volunteers.\nArchitecture and Furnishings\nDesigned in the traditional Cantonese style, the Former Thong Chai Medical Institution is one of the few surviving examples of secular Cantonese architecture in Singapore. The straight, ornamented roof ridge, coupled with the gable-end walls shaped like Chinese wok handles, is typical of Cantonese buildings. Within the compound are three courtyards. This elongated plan, also common in urban residences in Guangdong Province, China, is aptly referred to as ‘bamboo house’ (竹筒屋) by the Cantonese.\nFacing the front courtyard is an elaborate pierced-relief carving on giltwood which hangs from the roof. It depicts the an ba xian (暗八仙, ‘Treasures of the Eight Immortals’), or weapons wielded by the Taoist Eight Immortals. They are believed to possess powers to ward off evil and attract good fortune. Calligraphic inscriptions that describe the charitable deeds of Thong Chai Medical Institution and those of the early Chinese community in Singapore are proudly displayed in the high-ceilinged main hall where patients had their consultations. The first characters of each pair of matching couplets form the name of the institution: tong and ji. In the past, the rear hall housed the dispensary, and herbs were laid out to dry in the rear courtyard.\nThong Chai Medical Institution Today\nThong Chai Medical Institution operated within the building until 1979. It then moved to new premises on Chin Swee Road, where it has continued to provide free traditional Chinese healthcare to people from all walks of life until the present day.\nOur National Monuments\nOur National Monuments are an integral part of Singapore’s built heritage, which the National Heritage Board (NHB) preserves and promotes for posterity.

He was the top student from Raffles Institution in the Senior Cambridge examinations of 1940. He then entered Raffles College with the hopes of going on to study law in London, but his plans were interrupted by World War II.\nAfter the British surrendered to the Japanese on 15 February 1942, Mr Lee narrowly escaped being killed in sook ching (“purge by cleansing”) — the Japanese army’s anti-Chinese operation which took the lives of many Chinese. He had gone to the Jalan Besar sook ching screening, but sensing something was wrong, he excused himself from the line-up. He hid with his gardener’s help and fortuitously cleared the screening the next day. He later recalled that he did not choose to enter politics; it was the Japanese occupation that brought politics to him. The brutal occupation forced him to realise that unless Singaporeans took their fate into their own hands, they would forever be at the mercy of major powers.\nLee Kuan Yew with Kwa Geok Choo, before he left for England to study, 5 September 1946.

He first enrolled at the London School of Economics, and then moved to the University of Cambridge in 1947. He graduated from Cambridge with “Double First” honours in Law and received the only star for distinction in his year.\nReading by the River Cam at Cambridge University, 1947.

The Forum was a group of politically conscious Malayan students in Britain who were working towards an independent Malaya, which would include Singapore. Mr Lee returned home after being called to the Bar in June 1950.\n\"The time has come for Malayans to unite, for we can’t stop this exploitation unless we are masters in our own country. So that is the first thing that has to be put right. We’ve got to have independence.\"\n– Lee Kuan Yew, at an election rally, 21 March 1955\nRoad to Merdeka (1950 –1965)\nLegal adviser to trade unions\nIn 1952, Lee Kuan Yew represented the Postal and Telecommunications Uniformed Staff Union in its salary negotiations with the colonial government. He exposed the high-handedness with which the postal workers had been treated, but advised them to adopt a peaceful, moderate approach in the negotiations. Mr Lee gained wide publicity after he succeeded in negotiating a better deal for the postal workers. Soon, more trade unions and clan associations began approaching him to be their advocate.\nAt the Singaporean Union of Postal and Telecommunication Workers' premises for the PAP's Special Party Conference, 3 February 1955. It was decided at the meeting at the PAP would contest the upcoming Legislative Assembly Election. Four candidates, including Lee Kuan Yew, were fielded.\nFormation of the People’s Action Party (PAP)\nTogether with a small group of students who had recently returned from England, Lee Kuan Yew developed the idea of forming a political party to fight for independence through constitutional means. This group — Toh Chin Chye, Goh Keng Swee, S. Rajaratnam and Kenneth Byrne, joined later by Samad Ismail and Devan Nair — met regularly in the basement dining room of Mr Lee’s home in Oxley Road.\nThe Fajar trial\nIn 1954, Lee Kuan Yew was approached to defend eight University of Malaya students who had been charged with sedition for publishing an article in Fajar, an undergraduate magazine. Together with Queen’s Counsel D. N. Pritt, Mr Lee defended the students successfully. Soon after, he represented Chinese middle-school students who were appealing their conviction for rioting over National Service registration. This was Mr Lee’s introduction to the Chinese educated world. As he described it, it was “a world teeming with vitality, dynamism and revolution”.\nGreeting Queen's Counsel D. N. Pritt at the airport, 1954. Pritt had own in to represent eight University of Malaya students charged with sedition for an article published in Fajar, an undergraduate publication. All eight were acquitted.\nInauguration of the PAP\nThrough these students, Lee Kuan Yew became acquainted with Lim Chin Siong and Fong Swee Suan, two influential figures in the Communist United Front. Mr Lee told them of his plans to form a political party, and they soon joined the Oxley Road group. On 21 November 1954 the PAP was inaugurated at the Victoria Memorial Hall.\nThe 1955 Legislative Assembly Election\nThe PAP put up four candidates, including Lee Kuan Yew. The PAP won three seats, with Mr Lee himself winning the largest number of votes cast for any candidate. He had emerged as the natural leader of the anti-colonial movement.\nLee Kuan Yew with his supporters on the eve of his first electoral triumph, 1 April 1955\n\"Once in a long while in the history of a people, there comes a moment of great change. Tonight is such a moment in our lives... We begin a new chapter in the history of Singapore. The powers of the people through their elected government are limited to our internal affairs. It is not what we really want. It is but a step forward towards merger and Merdeka.\"\n– Lee Kuan Yew, at a mass rally following the PAP’s victory in the 1959 Singapore General Election, 3 June 1959\nOpen front alliance\nLee Kuan Yew and his non-communist colleagues in the PAP felt they had to forge an alliance with the communists to fight colonialism. But this meant a constant tussle for control within the PAP. Mr Lee secretly met Fong Chong Pik, a representative of the Malayan Communist Party whom he named “the Plen”, short for Plenipotentiary, in his Battle for Merger talks.\nShouting \"Merdeka!\" (Independence in Malay) at a rally at the Padang, 15 April 1957. Lee Kuan Yew had returned from London. He had been a member of the all-party delegation attending constitutional talks on self-government for Singapore.\nThe 1959 General Election\nThe PAP took 43 out of 51 seats in Singapore’s first general election for a fully-elected legislature. It was a landslide win. Lee Kuan Yew became the first Prime Minister of self-governing Singapore. He began immediately implementing the far-reaching social and economic policies that transformed the island over the next few decades.\nSpeaking on the steps of City Hall at the installation of Yusok bin Ishak as Yang di-Pertuan Negara (Head of State), 3 December 1959.\nUrging residents of Tanjong Pagar to help make Singapore \"one of the cleanest and healthiest cities in Asia\" during a mass drive to spring clean the city, 23 November 1959.\nIndependence through merger\nIn May 1961, the Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya, Tunku Abdul Rahman, announced the possibility of a merger with Singapore. Disagreement over this issue prompted a split in the PAP in July 1961. The pro-communists led by Lim Chin Siong first tried to bring down the government in the Legislative Assembly. When they failed, they broke away to form the Barisan Sosialis. The trade unions also split — those loyal to the PAP formed the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), while the pro-communist unions set up the Singapore Association of Trade Unions (SATU).\nThis resulted in a fierce battle for the hearts and minds of Singaporeans. Lee Kuan Yew made a series of radio broadcasts to expose the communists — their aims, methods and organisation — and visited all 51 constituencies. A referendum was held in September 1962 in which the PAP’s proposal for merger with the Federation won 71 percent of the votes. A year later, on 16 September 1963, Singapore became part of Malaysia. Five days after Merger, the PAP won 37 seats in the 1963 General Elections, compared to the Barisan Socialis’ 13. The PAP — with Mr Lee’s “superb political generalship,” as Dr Goh Keng Swee later described it — had survived the communist onslaught.\nSpeaking at the Victoria Memorial Hall after his victory in the 1963 General Elections, 22 September 1963.\nSeparation\nMerger, however, turned out to be an unhappy experience. The PAP contested the 1964 Malaysian General Election, but won only one seat in the peninsula.\nAddressing the crowd at Fullerton Square during a lunchtime election rally, 25 September 1963.\nRacial riots broke out in Singapore on 21 July 1964. Relations between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur deteriorated as Lee Kuan Yew campaigned for a non-communal “Malaysian Malaysia”.\nListening to residents of Geylang Serai in the wake of racial riots, 24 July 1964. On television the same day, Lee Kuan Yew pledged to help victims of the riots and said his government would dispel fear and restore confidence.\nOn 9 August 1965, Singapore separated from Malaysia. The image of Mr Lee on television crying over this “moment of anguish” was something no Singaporean would forget.\n\"I have a responsibility for the survival of the two million people in Singapore... my overriding, my paramount duty is the survival of my own people... I am determined that they will survive and I think they’ve got enough grit in them.\"\n– Lee Kuan Yew, interview with foreign correspondents, 14 August 1965\nSurvival and Nationhood (1965 –1990)\nThis period has been closely identified with Lee Kuan Yew’s leadership and strength of character. Assisted by a group of exceptionally able colleagues, he transformed Singapore into a progressive, open and economically successful nation.\nObtaining international recognition for Singapore\nLee Kuan Yew believed that it was most important to position Singapore in the international system. Before Singapore’s independence, he had already been meeting key figures of that time (including Nehru, Nasser and Tito) and leading missions to Africa and Australia on behalf of Malaysia. He put this experience to good use as soon as Singapore became independent.\nRule of law and non-corruptibility\nLee Kuan Yew initiated constitutional changes and adapted the rule of law to the local context. He insisted on high standards of probity in government and was relentless in fighting corruption. He believed the success of the country depended on the strength and integrity of its institutions, particularly the civil service and the judiciary.\nA Singaporean Singapore\nLee Kuan Yew envisioned a meritocratic, multiracial, multi-religious and multi-lingual society, where no one would be favoured or discriminated against because of their race, language or religion. He shunned race-based political parties and stressed the importance of racial and religious harmony. In education, he instituted bilingualism with English as the medium of instruction and with Mandarin, Malay and Tamil as the mother tongues. There shall be no majorities or minorities in Singapore, he declared soon after Separation. He combated chauvinism in all its forms.\nBuilding a defence force\nTo ensure Singapore’s security, Lee Kuan Yew worked closely with Defence Minister Goh Keng Swee to build up the Singapore Armed Forces. In 1967, he introduced compulsory National Service for all 18-year-old male citizens. 900 full-time National Servicemen were enlisted in the first batch that year.\nSurviving without the British military\nIn the 1960s, the British military bases contributed about 20 percent to Singapore’s Gross Domestic Product. After the British announced in 1968 they were withdrawing their forces “East of Suez”, Lee Kuan Yew negotiated with British leaders a generous aid package and a postponement of the date British forces would leave Singapore, from March to December 1971. He also set up the Bases Economic Conversion Department, led by Hon Sui Sen, to oversee the conversion of British military bases and facilities into commercial use. In this way, by boldly turning crisis into opportunity, Singapore survived the British withdrawal. That was to become a hallmark of Mr Lee’s leadership as Singapore tackled the crises of the 1970s and 1980s.\n\"We cannot go backwards in time, to the old trading port of Singapore. We have to move forward and upwards, diversify our economy, upgrade technology in factories and offices, and increase our knowledge and skills.\"\n– Lee Kuan Yew, National Day Message, 8 August 1982\nEstablishing Singapore’s economic base\nUnique among leaders of developing nations of his time, Lee Kuan Yew welcomed multi-national companies. He saw them as a means of industrialisation and to link up Singapore to the world. Central to his economic vision was the establishment of industrial harmony. Mr Lee worked closely with Devan Nair and the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) to promote tripartism. The National Wages Council was set up in 1972 with representatives from unions, management and government to achieve a consensus on wage issues.\nCreating a financial centre\nTogether with Dr Goh Keng Swee, Lee Kuan Yew helped make Singapore a global financial centre. In 1967, the Board of Commissioners of Currency was established to issue the Singapore currency. In 1971, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the country’s de facto central bank, was established. And in 1981, the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) was formed to invest government reserves. Mr Lee served as GIC chairman from its founding till 2011.\nA stake for each citizen\nGiving every citizen a stake in the country was of primary importance to Lee Kuan Yew. His vision was a nation where every citizen owned a home. So he set up the Housing and Development Board to build and sell flats to Singaporeans. As wages rose, Mr Lee also raised the Central Provident Fund contribution rates to help Singaporeans buy homes and ensure they have adequate retirement savings. In 1984, he initiated Medisave, a national medical savings scheme. These schemes and institutions — HDB, CPF, Medisave — remain the bedrock of Singapore’s social policy today.\nThanking a supporter on Nomination Day in the 1997 General Elections, 23 December 1996.\nOrganising the grassroots\nTo nurture confidence and trust between the people and the government, Lee Kuan Yew set up the People’s Association and became its first chairman. Community Centres were built all over the island to bring people together. In addition, Mr Lee launched many campaigns — from “Keep Singapore Clean and Green” to “Speak More Mandarin, Less Dialect”. He and his old Guard colleagues considered themselves to be public educators as much as political leaders.\n\"People must feel that Singapore is worth being part of and worth defending. Otherwise, we cease to exist... We can make Singapore a vibrant and thriving society, with opportunities for a rewarding and fulfilling life. \"\n–Lee Kuan Yew, National Day Message, 8 August 1989\nEstablishing international relations\nLee Kuan Yew helped Singapore establish strong relations with major powers like the United States, China, India, Japan and the United Kingdom. He welcomed the United States as a stabilising force in the Asia-Pacific region. His rapport with Deng Xiaoping led to the strengthening of ties with China from the 1980s. Mr Lee was well received by the top world leaders of his time.\nMeeting United States President Ronald Reagan at the White House, 19 June 1981. Lee Kuan Yew had met every US president since Lyndon Johnson.\nProposing a toast to Senior Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping of China when he visited Singapore, 12 November 1978.\nThe Commonwealth and ASEAN\nLee Kuan Yew ensured Singapore’s voice was heard on the world stage. Singapore hosted the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in 1971, with Mr Lee as the chairman. Together with his Foreign Minister S Rajaratnam, Mr Lee was a strong supporter of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which he viewed as important to regional stability.\nPlacing Singapore on the world map\nMr Lee took a personal interest in Singapore Airlines (SIA), and urged it to focus on international rather than regional routes. His decision to build Changi International Airport, which opened in 1981, helped Singapore become the air hub of the region.\nA clean and green Singapore\nMr Lee believed in a clean and green environment. He was the inspiration and chief architect of Singapore’s transformation into a “garden city”, and later into a “city in a garden”. The clean-up of the Singapore River and the Kallang River basin — a massive project that took 10 years to complete — together with the waterways, parks and trees that dot Singapore’s landscape are among the most enduring of Mr Lee’s achievements.\nInspecting the Singapore River, 2 September 1987. Lee Kuan Yew considered the decade-long project to clean up the river one of his most ambitious undertakings.\nThe water story\nSingapore’s dependence on Malaysia for its water was a matter of profound importance. Lee Kuan Yew was the key figure in all bilateral talks with Malaysia over water. Thanks to his leadership, Singapore focused on developing its own water resources. This included converting more than three- quarters of the island into water catchment areas, developing desalination plants and introducing NEWater or reclaimed water.\nLeadership succession\nLee Kuan Yew believed that the continued success of Singapore depended on having capable people in government, especially its political leadership. After the 1988 General Elections, he paved the way for Goh Chok Tong to succeed him as Prime Minister. He saw this as his final duty as Prime Minister before stepping down in 1990.\n\"... my values are for a government which is honest, effective and efficient in protecting its people and allowing opportunities for all to advance themselves in a stable and orderly society, where they can live a good life and raise their children to do better than themselves...\"\n–Lee Kuan Yew, keynote speech at the Create 21 Asahi Forum in Tokyo, 20 November 1992\nHis Legacy\nSenior statesman\nLee Kuan Yew stepped down as Prime Minister in 1990, but remained in the Cabinet as Senior Minister.\nPrime Minister Goh Chok Tong and President Wee Kim Wee witnessing the swearing in of Lee Kuan Yew as Senior Minister at City Hall Chamber, 28 November 1990.\nHe was appointed Minister Mentor in August 2004, when Lee Hsien Loong succeeded Goh Chok Tong as Prime Minister.

Nathan presenting Lee Kuan Yew with his instrument of appointment as Minister Mentor at the Istana, 12 August 2004, witnessed by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.\nMr Lee had an active post-Prime Ministerial career, and his presence was felt both at home and abroad. One of the highlights of these years was the publication of his two-volume memoirs. It was translated into many languages, including Spanish, Portuguese and French, reflecting the worldwide interest in the views of Asia’s pre-eminent elder statesman.\nSpeaking at the launch of the second volume of his memoirs, From Third World to First, 16 September 2000.\nLegacy\nLee Kuan Yew’s legacy is Singapore. He devoted every fibre of his being, the full measure of his considerable talents and energy, to the betterment of his fellow citizens. He believed in a fair and just society, one in which every citizen had a stake. He believed we could be “one united people, regardless of race, language or religion”. He believed government had to be honest and strong if it was to be a force for good. He thus insisted on the rule of law, meritocracy and zero tolerance of corruption. It is upon these solid foundations laid by Lee Kuan Yew and his generation of leaders that Singapore will continue to thrive in the decades to come.", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/in-memoriam-lee-kuan-yew-1923-2015/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/in-memoriam-lee-kuan-yew-1923-2015/in-memoriam-lee-kuan-yew-2.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:47"},

Created by Belgian comic artist Georges Remi (1907-1983) – also known as Hergé, Tintin is a teenage journalist who began a series of exciting adventures in 1929, accompanied by his faithful dog Snowy; and later his faithful friends Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus.\nTintin’s adventures, which spanned 24 comic books, took the young reporter and Snowy to various places around the world. They ventured into India, Tibet and China in Asia; to the Congo in Africa; Arabia in the Middle East; Russia in Europe; North and South America; and even the Moon!\nShown in this exhibition were stamps from SPM’s permanent collection. Also on display were a wide range of Tintin collectibles and rarely seen original stamp artworks on loan from the Museum Voor Communicatie in the Netherlands and L’Adresse Musée de La Poste in France.\nHergé – Creator of Tintin\nIt is difficult to separate Hergé’s life from his work. As a child, his sketches lined the margins of his exercise books. During his teenage years, he was always with his sketchbook, and his adult life was spent eternally stuck to his drawing board.\nHis fictional creation was part of him, living within him and playing key roles in his life. His life influenced his creation, and his creation influenced his life.\nFrom youth to adulthood, Hergé drew alone, with the occasional one-off collaborations. His was the work of a master craftsman, and it came from his heart and his technical expertise. But when Hergé reached the age of 40, he began to favour working within a team and set up Studios Hergé in 1950.\nHergé’s studio allowed many talented artists to flourish and develop their own work. It became an institution dedicated to the conservation and exhibition of the clear line style. Hergé was the artistic director of Tintin magazine and the managing director of Studios Hergé. But he was more of a mentor than the boss of a company.\nScout’s Honour\nIn 1921, the young Hergé joined the Saint-Boniface College scout group. He was given the nickname ‘Curious Fox’.\n“It was with scouting that the world really began to open up in front of me. It’s the greatest memory of my youth. Being close to nature, respecting nature, resourcefulness. It was all very important to me and even if it all seems a bit old-fashioned today, I still hold dear the values we learned.”\n– Hergé, 1974\nThe budding artist was always with his sketchbook and pencil, sketching scenes of daily scout-life, landscapes from his travels and life portraits. The teenager quickly built up a good reputation for drawing such subjects.\n• name: Georges Remi\n• date of birth: 22 May 1907\n• died: 3 March 1983 (age 75)\n• nationality: Belgian\n• father: Alexis Remi (1882 -1970)\n• mother: Elisabeth Dufour (1882 – 1946)\n• sibling: Paul Remi\n• spouse: First Wife – Germaine Kieckens, secretary of Father Wallez, director of Le Vingtième Siècle. Married in 1932, separated in 1960, and divorced in 1977.\n• spouse: Second Wife – Fanny Vlamynck, colourist by profession. Married in 1977.\n• children: None\n“As I was a boy scout, I started telling the story of a little boy scout to other little boy scouts...these were not yet real comic strips. They were more like stories with illustrations and from time to time, a shy little exclamation mark or question mark”\nHergé, 1975\nThe scout’s honour he so strongly embraced put him through traumatic nightmares when he was working on Tintin in Tibet. During this time, he suffered from dreams of a white monster that represented the personal conflict he had over whether he should divorce his wife of three decades to be with a 22-year-old employee.\nHis journey began\nAfter completing his studies in 1925, Hergé worked in the subscriptions department of the Belgian newspaper Le Vingtième Siècle (‘The Twentieth Century’).\nHe was talent spotted by Father Norbert Wallez, director of Le Vingtième Siècle. Noting Hergé’s abilities in lettering and illustration, Father Wallez entrusted the young man with his first graphic design assignment, such as the designing of headings, layout of newspaper columns and creation of dropped initials, tailpieces and illustrations.\nThree years later, Hergé was given his first real responsibility as an illustrator when he became the editor of Le Petit Vingtième (‘The Little Twentieth ’), the children’s supplement to Le Vingtième Siècle. The first issue was published on November 1 that year.\nHis creations\nHergé’s first drawings appeared in 1921 in Jamais assez, a scout magazine for schools; and then in Le Boy-Scout Belge, the monthly magazine of the Belgian scouts.\nFrom 1924 onwards, he signed his drawings as Hergé, a phonetic transcription of his initials G.R. in the reverse (pronounced as ‘Air-Zhay’ in French).\nHe created Totor, Patrol Leader of the May Bugs, in Boy-Scout Belge in 1926. On 10 January 1929, Tintin and Snowy made their debut in Le Petit Vingtième. In 1930, Hergé introduced Quick and Flupke, street urchins from the backstreets of Brussels who starred in short stories in Le Petit Vingtième. Tintin in the Land of the Soviets was published by Editions du Petit Vingtième in the same year.\nCinema in a comic strip\nHergé’s work drew inspiration from the art of film-making. The plots, atmosphere and framing that constituted his picture stories were all heavily influenced by cinematic style. This led to his adventures, recorded in mere ink on paper, turning out to be as animated and expressive as full-length features shown in the cinema.\nHergé treated his characters as actors and he used current events and from history for his scenes. In this way, his frames and speech bubbles speak directly to us.\n“I operate just like a film director. Firstly, there’s the scenario. In principle, I’m the scriptwriter as well ... It’s true that it’s very similar to the cinema. Then there’s the directing. The artist needs to be an actor and director simultaneously, and a draughtsman as well. He directs the actors. He has to feel when a character in a particular situation needs to run to the left or right or elsewhere. The artist also writes the dialogues, except in cases where there is a team with a scriptwriter and artist. In my case, I have to be everything at once.”\n– Hergé, 1971\nMan of letters\nHergé was a prolific writer. He was as demanding of his writing as he was of his drawing and painting. He left behind approximately 40,000 letters. While the majority were about his work, there were many that touched on love, his emotions and social life.\nThese writings bear witness to the author’s character and taste.\nThis is an extract of a letter he wrote to a young girl, Anne le B., from Casablanca. She had written to him about her teenage loneliness, thinking that she was writing to Hergé’s grandfather!\n“Dear Miss,\nIn response to your esteemed letter of 20 June, I have the honour of letting you know: that I don’t have a beard, yet if I did have one, it would not be white, but just going grey; that as I don’t have a beard, my grandchildren can’t pull it; that furthermore I’m not a true grandparent as I have neither beard nor grandchildren; that part of the reason I’m not a grandparent may be because I’m not even a father; that I limit myself to having just one wife, because that’s the Belgian custom, in contrast to your area, where the custom is to have several; that I don’t have anyone who really is the living model for Captain Haddock; that I do generally receive and see the letters I am sent; that if some malevolent force had made your hand disappear, I would have been deprived of this pleasure; and lastly that I am very keen on writing back to you, and here is the proof! Is there still anything else to write? Since you haven’t asked me anything, I don’t even have the ability to refuse you anything. Basically, you have confided that you don’t even have a rat to talk to. If I understand it correctly, you’ve promoted me to that flattering role. I am clean-shaven (‘ras’ in French) and I could also be your rat, given that our conversation would be rudimentary and short-lived. It’s not only in fairy tales that a hideous beast can be transformed into Prince Charming, in the big round eyes of a 16-year old princess.”\nTintin’s trademarks\nFamous Hairstyle\nHis little blond quiff. This quiff was formed only on pages 7-8 of Tintin in the Land of Soviets when he jumped into a car and raced away. The sudden acceleration gave him the distinctive quiff which became synonymous with Tintin. Since then the little tuft of hair never droops.\nPlus-Four Pants\nHe is always dressed in a plain yellow or white collared shirt, often with a blue sweater over, and his trademark plus-four trousers. But he traded his plus-fours for bellbottoms in Tintin and the Picaros.\nWho is Tintin?\n  Tintin was definitely born of my unconscious desire to be perfect, to be a hero.\n– Hergé.\nHergé has never confirmed who inspired him to create the Tintin character, and it may never be known who that was. But there are several claims.\nDanish actor Palle Huld (1912-2010)\nFor decades he had claimed that his 44-day round-the-world trip, made in 1928 when he was a 15-year-old scout, was the inspiration to the appearance of Tintin a year later in Le Petit Vingtième.\nFrench war and travel photo-journalist Robert Sexe (1890-1986)\nLike Tintin, he rode a motorbike and had a best friend called René Milhoux (Tintin’s dog, Snowy, is called Milou in French). He also toured the Soviet Union, the Congo and America in the same order as Tintin in the first three comic issues.\nPaul Remi, Hergé’s younger brother (1912-1986)\nA military officer, Paul Remi’s likeness to the comic character prompted the nickname “Major Tintin” by his colleagues. That led him to shave off his hair and sport a ‘crew-cut’ look. Hergé reciprocated by using this new look to create the villainous character Colonel Sponz, who was featured for the first time in The Calculus Affair.\n“My childhood companion and playmate was my brother, who was five years younger than me. I watched him, and he amused and fascinated me ... Undoubtedly, this explains how Tintin adopted his character, his gestures, his attitude.”\n– Hergé, 1943\nLast, but not least Herge&ecute; himself\nThe creator had claimed “Tintin, c’est moi” or “Tintin, it’s me.” ... “These are my eyes, my meaning, my lungs, my tripe! ... I believe that I am alone in being able to animate, in the sense of giving a soul.”\nKnow the cast\nHergé’s world was occupied by sharply defined characters. They were mostly inspired by real people who were either close to him, historical figures or celebrities at that time. Their portraits and psychological profiles had been meticulously composed, leaving nothing to chance.\n>>Snowy\nTintin’s constant companion is an extraordinary white wire fox terrier. He is known as “Milou” in French. There are several stories on whom Snowy was named after. One version was that Snowy was named after Hergé’s girlfriend Marie-Louise Van Cutsem who was called “Malou”. Another candidate was René Milhoux, the best friend of French war and travel photojournalist Robert Sexe, who was himself one of many speculated inspirations of the Tintin character.\nSnowy appeared right at the start, in the first drawing of the first adventure. He sticks by Tintin through good and bad times. He is faithful and courageous, saving Tintin in numerous adventures. He is known to be Tintin’s alter ego and his only confidant at the beginning.\n>>Captain Archibald Haddock\nThe arrival of Captain Haddock does in some way replace Snowy. The Captain has always been a bit naïve, temperamental, loud, emotional and irritable, but he has a good heart and is always willing to help people who are in trouble.\nHis first appearance was on pages 14 and 15 of The Crab with the Golden Claws in 1941. He has been a seafaring captain of over 20 years. His ancestor was Knight François de Hadoque who commanded the frigate, the Unicorn.\nSome of Captain Haddock’s distinctive features are his sailor outfit of black trousers, sailor’s hat and blue pullover with the image of an anchor; and a pipe in his mouth. His favourite exclamations are “Thundering Typhoons!” and “Blistering Barnacles!”\nHe is courageous but very clumsy, adding much comic relief to the stories. His main weakness is his excessive enjoyment of whisky and rum.\n>>Chang Chong-Chen\nThis character was inspired by a young Chinese student of similar name, >张仲仁 (1907- 1998), whom Hergé met in 1934 when Chang was studying at the Académie des Beaux-Arts in Brussels.\nThe extremely beneficial relationship inspired both Hergé’s professional and spiritual life. This marked a turning point in Hergé’s career, and was central to the creation of The Blue Lotus in 1935. Twenty-four years later Hergé celebrated his friendship with Chang again in Tintin in Tibet.\n“I think that Chang was, without knowing it, one of the artists who had the most influence on me. He was a young Chinese student whom I had first met at the time when he helped me to create The Blue Lotus, and it was he who made me aware of the absolute necessity of being well informed about a country and of constructing a narrative.”\n– Hergé, 29 April 1977\n  Chang returned to China after he completed his studies in 1937. He became the Principal of the Shanghai Fine Arts Academy and was a celebrated sculptor.\nThe two good friends lost contact when World War Two broke out. The Japanese occupation of China during the war, coupled with the Chinese Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), separated them for almost three decades. Hergé, however, never gave up looking for his friend. His long quest finally paid off in 1975, and they kept in contact through touching letters. It was not for another six years before Chang and Hergé had an emotional reunion in Brussels in 1981.\n>>Thompson & Thomson\nThese two clumsy policemen first appeared in Cigars of the Pharaoh in 1932. They were then known as X33 and X33A. Their names were revealed only in King Ottokar’s Sceptre in 1939.\nThe only way to distinguish between the two is from the trim of their moustaches. Thompson’s is neatly trimmed, whilst Thomson’s has a distinctive twirl at the ends.\nBoth Thompson and Thomson are not very intelligent, and are incredibly clumsy and confused. They are hence full of blunders, misunderstandings, and always in trouble. One possible inspiration for the characters was Hergé‘s father, Alexis Remi, and Alexis’ twin brother, Léon. They were identical twins; both had moustaches, were dressed alike, wore boater or bowler hats, and held walking canes or umbrellas. Thompson and Thomson, however, are not twins.\nHergé could also have been inspired by movies of that time, namely the films of Charlie Chaplin, as well as the comedic duo Laurel and Hardy who shared similarities in characteristics with Thompson and Thomson.\nProfessor Cuthbert Calculus\nHe is an absolutely deaf and absent-minded inventor whose French name is Tryphon Tournesol. “Tryphon” is the name of Hergé’s carpenter and “Tournesol” means sunflower. He was actually modelled after a real person.\n“Physically, Calculus and his submarine were based on Professor Auguste Piccard [1884-1962] and his bathyscaphe. He was a scaled down version of Piccard, who was much too tall. Piccard had a very long neck. I would occasionally bump into him in the street and he struck me as the incarnation of a typical scientist. I made Calculus a mini-Piccard, because otherwise I would have needed to enlarge the frames.”\n– Hergé\nCalculus’s deafness was modelled after Paul Eydt, the lawyer at Le Petit Vingtième. His deafness was a source of jokes amongst the editorial team.\n>>Roberto Rastapopoulos\nA dangerous Greek billionaire with the worst morals and taste in clothing, Rastapopoulos is a master of evil and the sworn enemy of Tintin.\nHis first appearance was in Tintin in America in 1932. He crossed paths with Tintin again in Cigars of the Pharaoh in 1934, The Blue Lotus in 1935, The Red Sea Sharks in 1958, and finally in Flight 714 in 1967.\nHe was modelled after the Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis (1906-1975), who made a fortune constructing super tankers and became legendary for his wealth and display of it.\n>>Dr. J.W. Müller\nViolent and dangerous, enterprising and unscrupulous, and thoroughly evil, Dr Müller’s personality was based on Dr Georg Bell, a secret agent cum forger and a Nazi troublemaker of Scottish descent.\nPhysically, Dr Müller was based on the British actor Charles Laughton who starred in the film The Island of Doctor Moreau (1933). Laughton played the role of a mad genius, a pioneer of genetic modification and super surgeon, joining animals and humans together to create monstrous hybrids.\nDr Müller made his first appearance in The Black Island in 1938 as an outlaw and a master of disguise who often assumed multiple identities.\nCelebrating Tintin through stamps\nThe Adventures of Tintin in 24 Albums\nThis 2007 stamp collection issued by the Belgium Post features the covers of all 24 titles of the Tintin comic book series, together with a portrait of Hergé.\nAlbums 2 to 9, which were originally in black and white, were republished in colour and in a fixed 62-page format between 1943 and 1947, as well as in 1955. Album 10 was the first to be published in colour right from the beginning. Albums 16 to 23 (and the revised editions of Albums 4, 7 and 15) were published with Studios Hergé.\nA shortage of paper during World War Two had restricted the comics to 62 pages instead of the 100-130 pages allowed before the war.\nThe Double-Adventure Sequels\nThe Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham’s Treasure were Hergé’s first attempt at dividing Tintin’s adventures into two parts.\nThe double-adventure was such a successful formula that Hergé repeated it in four other books. The second double-bill, which came right after Red Rackham’s Treasure, spanned The Seven Crystal Balls and Prisoners of the Sun. The third double-adventure was told in Destination Moon and Explorers on the Moon.\nHergé had attempted to create a sequel earlier in 1934 when he embarked on Tintin in the East in Le Petit Vingtième. But the resulting work, The Blue Lotus, was more of a companion volume rather than a straight sequel to the preceding book, Cigars of the Pharaoh.\nTintin on the Moon\nHergé’s world was filled with science and technology. He was an inquisitive artist who sought out and interviewed numerous scientific experts. The process reached its peak in Tintin’s adventure to the Moon.\nHergé had the ability to weave complicated scientific subject matters into truly remarkable stories. He drew inspiration from the space race between America and the Soviet Union in the 1950s, keeping close tabs on new developments in rocket science.\nTo ensure accuracy in his work, Hergé made a scale model of the Moon rocket to be featured in Destination Moon, and brought it to Paris for the approval of Professor Alexandre Ananoff, author of L’astronautique. The model could be dismantled to reveal each inner section clearly. Upon his return to Brussels, Hergé asked his assistants to draw the iconic red rocket based on his model.\n“I wanted Bob De Moor [one of Hergé’s assistants] ... to know exactly whichever part of the space vehicle the characters were to be found in. It was essential that each detail was in place, that everything was perfectly exact: the venture was too dangerous for me to be involved without guarantee.”\n– Hergé\nHergé was way ahead of his time. He put Tintin on the Moon in 1953, four years ahead of the Soviet Union which launched the first, unmanned, Sputnik rocket on 4 October 1957. And it was not until two decades later on 20 July 1969 that Neil Armstrong from the United States’ Apollo XI mission finally landed and set foot on the Moon. As a fitting outcome to this creative undertaking, Tintin became, in the eyes of many, the first man to walk on the Moon!\n“This is it! ... I’ve walked a few steps! ... For the first time in history of mankind there is an Explorer on the Moon!” – Tintin declared in 1953, 16 years before Neil Armstrong’ declaration of “ one small step for man, one Gian leap for mankind”\nTintin comics have been made into movies since 1960, when Tintin first appeared on the big screen in Tintin and the Golden Fleece. This was followed by Tintin and the Blue Oranges in 1964.\nIn 1969, Belvision Studios in Brussels produced a feature-length animated cartoon based on the book Prisoners of the Sun. In 1976, Moi, Tintin, a full-length documentary about Tintin and his creator, hit the screens.\nIn October 2011, The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn, made its debut as a computer animated 3D movie. Directed by Steven Spielberg, the movie script was based on three of the comic stories: The Crab with the Golden Claws, The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham’s Treasure. A new set of stamps was issued by bpost (Belgium Post) on 27 August 2011 to mark this special occasion.\nLucille Yap is Senior Curator, Singapore Philatelic Museum.", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/about-a-boy-the-adventures-of-tintin/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/about-a-boy-adventures-of-tintin/about-a-boy-the-adventures-of-tintin-1.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:48"},

The British colony was touted as an impregnable fortress, so there was a confidence that even if attacked, it would not be overwhelmed.6\nThe events of that day shattered Singapore's air of confidence. Meanwhile, aware of the weak defences on the northern border, the Japanese planned an invasion from Johor, and the first soldiers set foot on the shores of Singapore exactly two months later, on 8 February 1942.7\nThe Battle for Singapore had begun. \nA ruthless and swift invasion\nThe first Japanese troops crossed the narrow Johor Strait on assault boats and barges, entering Singapore under the cover of darkness. The 22nd Australian Brigade guarding the northern coastline was overwhelmed in just two hours.8\nThe Japanese swiftly repaired the bombed causeway to provide troops with another point of entry into Singapore.

Here is a man whose death will lighten your heart.\"\n– Excerpt from a manual issued to Japanese troops in Southeast Asia.9\nWith ruthless determination, the Japanese then moved swiftly to capture Bukit Timah's petrol, oil, and supply depots from the Allies on 11 February 1942. The Ford Factory was turned into the headquarters of the commander of the Japanese 25th Army in Southeast Asia, General Tomoyuki Yamashita.10\nOpium Hill – Singapore’s last line of defence\nWith Bukit Timah taken, allied troops were ordered to withdraw to the defensive perimeter along the city area, stretching from Pasir Panjang to Kallang. Among them were Lieutenant Adnan Saidi and the men of the “C” Company, 1st Malay Brigade, who put up the fierce fight in what became known as the Battle of Opium Hill.11\n“Biar putih tulang, jangang putih mata.” (Death before dishonour)\n–Lt Adnan Saidi, 1st Malay Brigade, Battle of Opium Hill12\nThe Malay Regiment, led by Lieutenant Adnan Saidi, fought one of the fiercest battles against the Japanese in Singapore. (c.1941. Image from National Archives of Singapore)\nForced to retreat to Bukit Chandu from Pasir Panjang Ridge with a platoon of only 42 soldiers,13 Lt Adnan and his men were heavily outnumbered. At one point during the battle, they  foiled an infiltration attempt by the Japanese, who were wearing captured British Army uniforms, by recognising that they were marching in a line of four columns, not the usual three columns typical of British troops. As the fighting dragged on and with ammunition ran running out, the men of \"C\" company engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. They were eventually overwhelmed but refused to surrender. Their commitment enraged the Japanese, who reportedly hung Lt Adnan upside down on a tree and stabbed him to death.14\nAfter taking Bukit Chandu,15 the Japanese troops moved further inland, eventually reaching the British Military Hospital (now Alexandra Hospital). Despite being offered peaceful intent by a British officer, the Japanese soldiers rounded up about 260 staff and patients, and massacred them the next morning.16 After a discussion with his commanders at the Fort Canning Bunker (Battle Box), Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival, the commanding officer of the British Commonwealth Forces in Malaya, officially surrendered Singapore to the Japanese at the Ford Factory. The date was 15 February 1942, just one week after the first Japanese troops landed in Singapore,17\nLieutenant-General Arthur Ernest Percival on his way to surrendering Singapore to the Japanese at the Ford Factory in Bukit Timah on 15 February 1942.

The Sook Ching Massacre saw people suspected of being anti-Japanese executed along the beaches of Punggol, Changi, Katong, Tanah Merah and Blakang Mati (now Sentosa Island). Massacres were said to have also occured at Hougang, Thomson Road, Changi Road, Siglap, Bedok and East Coast. Due to a lack of written records, the exact number of people killed in the operation is unknown. The official figure given by the Japanese is 5,000, although the actual number is believed to much higher.20\n\nWitness statement of the 'Sook Ching' Massacre. (c. May 1946.

The Japanese issued a new local currency, informally known as ‘banana money’, but hyperinflation caused its value to drop drastically, so that eventually almost nothing could be purchased with it.22 \nPrisoners-of-war (POWs) were forced into hard labour and being imprisoned in cramped cells ridden with disease. They were also made to sign a pledge of non-escape, after four prisoners attempted to flee from Selarang camp. This was a violation of the Geneva Convention, which gave POWs the right to escape.23\nBanana money was the local currency issued by the Japanese during the occupation. Massive inflation rendered these notes practically useless.

Tracing its history allows us to understand how brick-and-mortar tour agencies had shaped the experiences of Singaporean travellers and responded to changing travel trends during the 1960s-90s.\nText by Chong Wen Xiu Trina (NTU History Programme)\n\nPre-COVID, Singapore ranked among the most popular tourist destinations worldwide. The Singapore Tourism Board (formerly Singapore Tourist Promotion Board) had taken deliberate efforts to attract visitors to the little red dot. But from the 1980s, Singapore was just as notable for its outbound tourism, having seen more than 500,000 tourist departures in 1986. Have you ever wondered what travelling was like for Singaporeans during the 1960s-90s?\nTravel, especially for leisure, did not gain much traction in the first decade of Singapore’s independence. The economic challenges of unemployment and shrinking entrepot trade meant that many Singaporeans could afford neither the time nor money to go on a holiday. Leisure tourism was thus a luxury that only a minority of Singaporeans had access to. Contrastingly, short trips to neighbouring Malaysia were popular especially during the Lunar New Year. \nFor the lucky ones, securing a train or air ticket to a foreign country was just the start. A successful trip required elements such as accommodation, food and transport to places of interest. Yet in the 1960s-early 1970s, sources of information that tourists could rely on were limited and disparate. Travel guidebooks by Lonely Planet and tourist maps informed Singaporean travellers about the history, customs and attractions of various destinations. These formal resources were supplemented by word of mouth from experienced travellers with useful tips to impart to their less experienced counterparts. Nonetheless, the scarcity of such resources made it a hassle to plan trips. \nBrochures promoting Free & Easy trips for independent travellers, 1990s. Courtesy of Chan Brothers Travel\nIt was in this context of ‘information underload’ that tour agencies rose in influence. In a modest pre-war shophouse at Cecil Street stood Chan Brothers Travel, a three-staff company that initially sold air and train tickets to nearby countries. The company was founded in 1965 by Mr Chan Liang Choy who recognised the potential for growth in the travel and tourism industry as Singapore’s economy developed. Born in China’s Fujian Province in 1924, Mr Chan Liang Choy had worked for several years in Myanmar and Singapore before starting a business in his family name at age 41. The business soon began selling guided tour packages. Several years and many successful tours later, Chan Brothers Travel moved to Fook Hai Building and became a household name. \nThe first Chan Brothers Travel office at 78 Cecil Street, 1965. Courtesy of Chan Brothers Travel\nChan Brothers Travel provided a one-stop solution for travellers who lacked the know-how and/or patience to settle their travel arrangements. The direct links the company enjoyed with airlines, hotels and overseas agents enabled it to streamline the booking process while providing its customers with reliable, affordable services. A tour booking typically started with a trip to the Chan Brothers Travel office at Fook Hai Building, where one would be handed a collection of travel brochures indicating the prices and itineraries of available packages. Albums that compiled photographs taken by Chan Brothers Travel tour leaders on previous trips were also used as a sales tool to pique the potential customer’s interest in destinations on offer. A week or two before the trip, mass pre-departure briefings would also be conducted in mini theatrettes in the Chan Brothers Travel office.\nCustomers of Chan Brothers Travel would be attended to by tour salespersons, 1986. Courtesy of Chan Brothers Travel\nCustomers of Chan Brothers Travel would be attended to by tour salespersons, 1986. Courtesy of Chan Brothers Travel\nBy the 1980s, Chan Brothers Travel tours not only covered Asian destinations like Hong Kong, Thailand and the Philippines, but also distant countries in Australia, Europe and North America. The diversity of destinations indicated Chan Brothers Travel’s success, which was related to Singaporeans’ growing appetite for travel. \nBrochures were used to promote tour packages, 1987. Courtesy of Chan Brothers Travel\nIndeed, the 1980s saw a significant boom in the outbound travel market. Rising income levels coupled with the opening of Singapore Changi Airport in 1981 made travel easier and more affordable. Singaporeans redefined the value of travel: as a necessary respite from the monotony of work, a family bonding experience and even a retirement reward. But as travellers became more seasoned, their expectations and traveling styles also evolved. This led Chan Brothers Travel to expand and differentiate their product offerings. \nIn 1983, the company introduced the “hotel-on-wheels” concept which brought Singaporeans on tours around Europe in double decker buses fitted with sleeping berths and a kitchen. The tours resembled a camping trip since travellers were involved in the cooking and cleaning. A Free and Easy Travel department was also set up to render travel assistance to those who preferred to travel independently. Other available itineraries included romantic trips for couples, school trips and incentive trips. Evidently, travel preferences shifted over time and tour agencies like Chan Brothers Travel had to adapt to these changes in order to remain relevant and competitive. \nCover of a brochure promoting Chan Brothers Travel’s ‘Hotel-on-Wheels’ holidays, 1983.

Ms Koh, a former tour leader at Chan Brothers Travel shared that besides managing the group and explaining sites of interest, tour leaders also needed to respond effectively to unforeseen situations like injuries or flight delays. Some travellers might even request special arrangements such as flowers or a cake for their wedding anniversaries. \nRecognising the significant role played by tour leaders, Chan Brothers Travel embarked on a consultancy project with the National Productivity Board (predecessor of the Standards, Productivity and Innovation Board or SPRING Singapore) in 1990 to provide customised employee training. The first of its kind in the travel industry, the project was extended to all of its 150 employees, from tour leaders to front desk salespeople. In line with their business philosophy of “Always, service with a smile”, in-house training on counter sales and telephone techniques were prioritised. The reigning Miss Hong Kong, Ms Pauline Yeung, was invited to officiate Chan Brothers Travel’s 1988 in-house courtesy campaign which aimed to promote the importance of courtesy in the service industry.\nMs Pauline Yeung at the launching ceremony of Chan Brothers Travel’s Miss/Mr Courtesy Campaign, 1988.

Courtesy of Chan Brothers Travel\nChan Brothers Travel’s heavy emphasis on its people serves as a reminder of the irreplaceable human element of engaging brick-and-mortar travel agencies. Even if online travel agencies (OTAs) can complete the same tasks that brick-and-mortar travel agencies can, they arguably cannot replicate the personalised, real-world customer experience that the latter excels in. \nThe start of post-pandemic travel spells exciting opportunities for tour agencies like Chan Brothers Travel which have been directly affected by global travel restrictions. For travellers who are unconfident about navigating the hodgepodge of COVID-19 guidelines, the services of brick-and-mortar tour agencies may prove immensely valuable. \nAbout Partner\nThe NTU History Programme strives to be a leading centre for researching and teaching interdisciplinary, Asian, and world/transnational history, while pushing innovative and immersive approaches to learning about and exploring Singapore's past and heritage.

Text by Low Sze Wee\nBeMuse Volume 4 Issue 2 – Apr to Jun 2011\nA recent edition of BeMUSE1 featured a painting by Pu Ru 溥儒 (1896-1963) titled A Copy of the “Beauties on an Outing” by Li Gonglin from the Asian Civilisations Museum collection (Fig.1).\nFig. 1.

Gift of the Tan family in memory of their late father, Dr Tan Tsze Chor.\nApart from its intrinsic beauty, the work epitomises a key feature of Chinese painting, which is a reverence for the past through the act of copying. As its title suggests, the painting is based on a work attributed to an earlier artist, Li Gonglin 李公麟 (1049-1106), from the Song dynasty.2 Li's work is also similar in composition and style to another painting, possibly done by the Song emperor Huizong 徽宗 (r. 1100-1126) who had in turn copied a now-lost work of Tang dynasty artist Zhang Xuan 张萱 (713-755)!3\nA colophon was later added to Pu’s painting by scholar Rao Zongyi who pointed out that Pu was mistaken in thinking that the subject he chose was of a concubine leaving the court. According to Rao, the depicted scene is actually Lady Guoguo’s Spring Outing. The original painting by Li Gonglin is in the National Palace Museum in Taipei and can be used for verification (Fig. 1a).\nFig. 1a. Court Beauties on an Outing 丽人行, attributed to Li Gonglin 李公麟. Collection of the National Palace Museum, Taiwan, Republic of China.\nThe Tradition of Copying\nCopying is a common method of art training in many cultures. This is especially so for the ancient tradition of Chinese painting also known as maobi hua 毛笔画 or shuimo hua 水墨画. The tools used for such paintings (ink and colour pigments applied with a brush on paper or silk) have remained largely unchanged over 3,000 years.\nIn China, copying is a commonly accepted means of learning painting and calligraphy. As early as the sixth century, Xie He 谢赫 had mentioned the copying of old masterpieces as one of the Six Laws or Principles of Chinese painting aesthetics.4 Closer to our time, there is a well-known episode in the 1940s when Zhang Daqian and Xie Zhiliu spent nearly a year to document the Dunhuang cave murals in Gansu province by painting life-size reproductions. Interestingly, the murals themselves were also the result of copying in ancient times. The paintings’ outlines were initially produced through stencils. Relying on these stencilled outlines, Dunhuang artists then painted the final images directly on the walls. Zhang Daqian’s remarkable copying skills have given rise to a number of enduring controversies. One of the most prominent is the case of The Riverbank – a painting attributed to the 10th century master Dong Yuan by its owner, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, but which some recent scholars have suggested is a modern fake by Zhang.5\nIn Chinese painting, a beginner usually learns by copying his teachers' brushwork and composition, and from studying extant masterpieces, reproductions and instruction manuals. Once he has attained a sound foundation, he is then expected to develop a personal language that is a synthesis or reinterpretation of past styles, and one that reflects his personality, temperament and character. This is not to say that Chinese artists do not observe nature or are inept in capturing physical likeness. For them, studying nature is a key ingredient in art, but copying is a proven method of studying how earlier artists translated the physical form and, more importantly, the spirit of the three-dimensional world onto the two-dimensional surface of a painting. Moreover, in an era when mechanical reproduction was not yet available, making hand-painted copies was the only way of circulating widely admired works amongst artists and collectors. For instance, Su Shih 苏轼 of the Song dynasty was known to have lent old paintings to friends who wanted to have copies made.6 Sometimes, artists even created copies as a joke or to test their friends’ knowledge. And in a society where much respect is accorded to seniority and ancestry, artists have long been regarded as custodians and transmitters of culture and tradition. Hence, creating a work that refers to the past, especially the styles of great masters, signals an artist’s intent to be included as part of an illustrious lineage. In this way, making copies of paintings is seen as an exercise in virtuosity by artists who revere history. Pu’s painting, with its declared connections to antiquity, is a clear example of such aspirations.\nGenerally, there are three ways to make copies. The first is to make an exact copy by tracing an existing work (known as mo 摹). This ensures that the entire composition and scale are reproduced very closely. However, because tracing has to be done slowly, the final brushwork may lack fluidity and a sense of spontaneity. The other way is to make a freehand copy by studying the original closely (known as lin 临). In this more technically demanding method, the artist has more freedom in his brushwork, but an exact copy is virtually impossible. The third category of ‘copy’ paintings refers to works done in the style of a particular artist but not based on any specific painting. For such works (sometimes known as imaginary copies), an artist creates a new composition in the style of another. In the hands of a skilful artist, it is possible to get a good copy very close to the style of the master with confident free-flowing brushwork. Two paintings in the Asian Civilisations Museum collection, Landscape in the style of Huang Gongwang by Wang Yuanqi 王原祁 and Ink Plum Blossoms done in the style of Wang Mian by Qian Du 钱杜, are good examples of such imaginary copies. (Figs. 2 and 3)\nFig. 2. Wang Yuanqi (1642-1715), Landscape in the style of Huang Gongwang, 1711, 70.5 x 230.5 cm.

Qian Du, Ink Plum Blossoms done in the style of Wang Mian, 1821, 218.0 x 49.5 cm. Collection of Asian Civilisations Museum. Gift of the Tan family in memory of Dr Tan Tsze Chor.\nThe Problem of Copies\nThe general acceptance and proliferation of copies in Chinese art have made it conducive for unscrupulous dealers and artists to pass off copies as originals. Some Chinese connoisseurs consider it impolite or inelegant to expose the works of forgers; as a result, certain fraudulent works continue to be circulated in the market.7 For instance, artist and connoisseur Xiao Ping (b. 1942) was once asked by a friend to write a colophon on a painting of chrysanthemums by Fu Baoshi (1904-1965) which he felt was a fake. However, as the collector was a senior official whom he did not wish to offend, Xiao penned a colophon based on a poem of chrysanthemums by Fu, without mentioning the quality of the painting. He had hoped that whoever read his colophon in the future would be able to read between the lines and understand that he had declined to give an opinion on the authenticity of the painting.8\nTherefore, given the presence of an active art market, the existence of forgeries in China, as in other countries, is unsurprising. However, the circulation of copies is not only a problem for unwary collectors. It also poses challenges for curators and art historians who have to ascertain the authenticity of works in order to construct an accurate history of an artist’s practice and in the process, establish a better understanding of Chinese art history.\nGeneral Principles Of Authentication\nGenerally, the task of authenticating involves close examination of two main aspects of a painting – dating and authorship. Firstly, one has to determine if the work comes from the period of its purported date. If undated, then the work should have been produced sometime during the artist’s lifetime. This involves technical analysis to assess the age of the materials used in the painting. Advances in scientific analysis have made the results of such tests generally objective and incontrovertible. However, for authenticating recent paintings, especially those by 19th and 20th century artists, such tests are less helpful as forgers usually have little difficulty in obtaining raw materials which are still relatively plentiful today. Moreover, in a heated art market where demand for paintings exceeds supply, it is not inconceivable for copies of a famous artist’s works to be produced and sold even during his lifetime, which makes it even more difficult to authenticate a work based on its age.\nThat said, the correct age does not necessarily mean that the painting is authentic. After the age of the materials has been verified, the next task is to determine if the artist is the author of the painting. An authenticator’s conclusions are drawn after looking closely at the painting and comparing it with authentic works. This requires the authenticator to have an intimate understanding of the artist’s practice, down to details like the artist's favoured type of paper to the places he travelled to and the people he met during his lifetime. It also requires a sufficiently large number of reliably authentic works for comparison. This can be a problem with very old works as few original works prior to the Song dynasty have survived. Sometimes, an artist may produce two genuine works with the same subject matter but of different quality. This poses difficulties later on as authenticators will have to decide which of the two genuine works to use for comparison purposes. Similarly, forgers may sometimes forge the works of artists whose paintings are long-lost, hoping that such works could never be verified against authentic extant ones.9\nAmbiguous Cases\nHowever, the question of what comes from the artist’s own hand is made murkier by paintings copied with the knowledge or authority of the artist. This has happened when the artist could not cope with high demand for his paintings and had to rely on students or relatives who could make relatively faithful copies to supply the needed works.10 The artist would complete the copy by writing the accompanying inscription and signature, with perhaps a few additional brushstrokes here and there to ‘improve’ the painting.11\nEqually controversial is the practice of separating a painting into two. Chinese paintings are usually done on paper made from multiple layers of pulp. For a sufficiently thick painting, a skilful mounter can divide the work into two by carefully separating the paper layers to produce two thinner sheets. This results in two identical paintings. Both layers bear the same image since the ink would have penetrated both layers during the painting process. The only slight difference is that the image on the top layer tends to be sharper and have richer tones than the one on the bottom.12 However, it could be argued that both paintings remain authentic as they came from the artist’s hands and no third party was involved in the painting process.\nTo complicate matters further, there are recorded instances when a famous artist such as Dong Qichang 董其昌 (1555-1636), whose works were very much in demand, sometimes even permitted his friends to use his name on their own works.13 Another similar episode recounts how an impoverished senior artist, too embarrassed to ask Zhang Daqian for a painting, once invited Zhang to paint a joint work, which the latter agreed. Zhang first painted the figures and the senior artist later added the landscape elements. For such a collaborative work, both artists would usually sign the painting. However, in this case, the senior artist did not sign and instead asked Zhang to write the inscription. Sympathetic to the senior artist’s plight, Zhang complied with the request, even though he realised that the work could eventually be passed off as a painting done entirely by Zhang, and hence command a higher price as compared to a collaborative work.14\nSpecific Methods of Authentication\n1. The Materials Of The Painting\nAs mentioned, the first task is to determine if a work comes from the period that it purports to date from. If undated, then the painting should have been produced sometime during the artist’s lifetime. A visual inspection is not sufficient as there are ways to create an aged or faded effect on new materials. For very old paintings, it is possible to send the paper or silk on which the painting is done, or the silk on which the painting is mounted, for scientific analysis. These tests usually provide a broad time period within which the paper or silk was made. Hence, they are more useful for authenticating older paintings rather than recent works. However, it should be noted that it is always possible for a resourceful forger to obtain old paper, silk and even ink sticks to make ink, and use them to create forgeries. This could extend to pulping blank pages from an old book to produce a piece of ‘old’ paper!15 Hence, even for genuinely old paintings, it is still necessary to determine if the painting was likely to have been painted by the artist.\nFor more recent works where the age of materials is not a useful guide of authenticity, an authenticator should be familiar with the types of paper, ink, seal paste and scroll mounting that the artist prefers or usually works with. Hence, a painting done on paper of a certain type would be suspect if the artist is not known to use that particular paper. However, such tests are never definitive. One can imagine a few possible scenarios where such anomalies may occur. For instance, the artist might have bought some new paper to try on but gave up after a few attempts. If those preliminary works survived, they would be hard to place within the artist’s overall output, especially if the artist did not mention these attempts to anyone.\n2. Scrutinising The Subject Matter\nOnce it is ascertained that the materials used are of the type that the artist is likely to have used, the next step is to determine if the subject matter of the painting is typical of the artist for that particular period of his career. In this case, the subject matter refers to all the visual elements found on the painting surface: the images (be it a landscape, bird and flower or human figures), the calligraphic inscriptions and signatures, and the seals.\nIn terms of the imagery, the authenticator should ascertain whether the artist is known to have painted certain subjects during a particular period. For instance, an artist may be known for painting landscapes but not for human figures. Likewise, the authenticator should also examine the calligraphic inscriptions, signatures and seals to see if they are typical of the artist for the period in question. For instance, some artists may change their signature or the type of seals they use as they get older. Hence, a painting is likely to be a forgery if it bears a signature or seal that is chronologically inconsistent with the artist’s known practice. A careful reading of the inscriptions may also be helpful in authentication. For example, a careless forger may write an inscription purporting that the painting was a gift for a famous patron, but mistakenly include a date beyond the lifetime of the said patron.\n3. Question Of Style\nEven if the subject matter is typical, the authenticator then needs to determine if the manner or style of painting and writing is typical of the artist and corresponds to his known style for that particular period. This would involve comparing the work in question with known authentic paintings of the same period. In analysing painting and writing styles, emphasis is paid on the brushwork, use of ink and colour, and overall composition. Brushwork can be expressed in many ways – dry or wet, dense or sparse, thick or thin, light or heavy, broken or continuous, smooth or energetic, soft or angular – the permutations are endless. Likewise, the use of ink and colour can be similarly varied from light to dark, sparse to heavy. Composition may also be highly individualistic, balanced or asymmetrical, static or dynamic and so on. In terms of writing, it is important to compare the spacing between columns and characters to ascertain if there is a pleasing rhythm in the flow of characters and a balanced, harmonious composition. Such stylistic analysis is based on the assumption that most artists, though their styles may change with time, usually paint and write in a certain way for a particular period.\n4. Determining Quality\nOnce it has been determined that the subject matter and style are consistent with the artist’s, the next aspect – quality – is the most difficult to ascertain. There is a common assumption that great artists always create good work, and a work of an ordinary or mediocre standard can never come from his hands. From a great artist, most would demand forceful brushwork, confident calligraphy, lively imagery, and a harmonious, if not striking composition. These are qualities that can reasonably be expected from works produced at the peak of his career. However, this necessarily also implies that works completed at an earlier age (when the artist’s skills were not yet fully honed or he was in transition between styles) or in his later years (when his physical faculties or energies were faltering) will understandably exhibit fewer of these desirable attributes. Forgers sometimes forge works from these periods precisely because authentic works created during those periods do not bear the artist’s mature style and will usually be accepted by collectors as being of secondary quality.16\nIn addition, a Chinese painting may be completed within a few hours, if not minutes. Hence, an artist could conceivably produce thousands of works in his lifetime. Therefore, it is unrealistic to expect every single work to exhibit the same high standards. Inevitably, there will be works of a lower quality, perhaps produced when the artist was unwell, tired, uninspired or simply, socially obligated.\n5. Tracking The Provenance\nLastly, after ascertaining that the age, subject, style and quality are consistent with the artist’s works of that period, the authenticator can further verify the work’s authenticity through its provenance, that is, the history of ownership of the work. This could be evident from the colophons – additional inscriptions – written by the painting’s various owners, either on the painting itself or its silk mounting borders. This is an accepted practice where owners either impress their seals or write a short piece of text to signal their ownership and appreciation of the work. This could then be verified against painting inventories maintained by the same collectors, where available. Emperors like Huizong from the Song dynasty and Qianlong (r. 1735-1796) from the Qing dynasty were famous for their inventories and these have proven invaluable in authenticating many paintings. However, listings in such inventories alone are not very useful as these inventories were seldom illustrated. Moreover, many artists tended to paint similar subjects or give their paintings similar titles such as ‘Fishing in the River’ or ‘Dwelling in the Mountains’, thereby making verification through such listings problematic. In recent times, it has become possible to obtain some form of verification from recollections of direct witnesses. These could be students, family members, collectors or close friends of the artist who were present when the painting was completed. These same individuals, if reliable, could also provide valuable information to prove that the painting was unlikely to have been produced by the artist. This is especially if they are privy to information that is not publicly known such as the artist’s likes or dislikes, or his habits when painting.\nDifficulties of Authentication\nIt is important to always keep in mind that authentication remains a subjective test. Apart from an artist’s direct testimony, all other evidence will be circumstantial, and the conclusion can never be definitive. In some instances, it is even possible to question an artist’s testimony, especially if his memory is failing or there are special circumstances where he may want to hide the truth. For instance, a Singapore art collector recounted that when the famous painter Guan Shanyue 關山月 (1912-2000) visited Singapore in 1986, he was asked by many local collectors to authenticate works in their collections. When confronted with fakes, Guan would make light of the awkward situation by joking that “I have painted numerous paintings over the decades, but I don’t seem to remember having done this particular one. In any case, this artist can probably do a better job than I can!”17\nAfter a thorough examination, the authenticator can, at most, opine that the painting is likely, very likely or unlikely to be the work of the artist. Even if the painting comes with a certificate of authenticity signed by the artist, there is no assurance that the work in question has not been replaced with a copy whilst in circulation. Generally, there are only a few instances when one can be reasonably certain that a work is genuine. They include works uncovered from archaeological sites, works obtained directly from the artist in his lifetime, and works donated by the artist to a public museum. In the latter case, it is then clear that the paintings did not have a chance to circulate in the open market where copies could be switched for originals.\nAuthentication requires very careful analysis and the application of any type of test will have to be done on a case-by-case basis. There are plenty of exceptions to the rule that have to be taken note of. For instance, when analysing a work based on an artist’s subject type, it is helpful to know that an artist’s subject preferences can change over time or he may favour several subjects concurrently. In addition, a landscape painter, pressured by a close friend or an important patron, may feel obliged to produce a portrait if faced with such a specific request. In such circumstances, it is understandable if the artist does not publicise the work’s existence. Hence, the fact that such works are unknown does not conclusively prove that they are not authentic.\nLikewise, it is inaccurate to assume that an artist only has one style of painting at any given period. A skilled artist could conceivably be proficient in several styles at the same time. For one occasion, he could paint a landscape in a spare style, done in pure ink with quick brushwork. For another occasion (or perhaps for a different patron), he could choose to depict the same landscape in a more decorative and elaborate style, full of colour and intricate detail. Sometimes, even stylistic analyses may not be very helpful. For instance, experts see little use in analysing Ming artist Qiu Ying’s signature when authenticating his works as Qiu had felt that his calligraphy was inferior and often invited friends to sign his works for him.18\nWhen analysing a painting’s quality, it is important to keep in mind the possibility of authentic works of low quality. Although many artists would be loathe to sell or give away inferior works, sometimes low-quality but authentic works may still leak into the open market without their knowledge. For instance, it is known that Xu Beihong had a habit of practising painting and calligraphy every morning, and often discarded unsatisfactory works by throwing them aside. Unknown to Xu, some admirers retrieved some of these unsigned works as keepsakes which later surfaced in the open market with spurious signatures or seals added on.19 Strictly speaking, these works cannot be considered fakes. Therefore, it is useful to keep in mind that a mediocre work does not necessarily mean that it is not authentic.\nLastly, just as the skills of authenticators increase over time, so have the abilities of resourceful forgers. For example, forgers are aware of the value placed on colophons for authentication. Hence, they are known to remove true colophons from original paintings and pair them with forged paintings in an attempt to give the fakes a veneer of pedigree. Similarly, a forger could also pair a fake colophon purportedly by a famous name with an authentic painting by a lesser name, in order to elevate the value of the painting.20 Art historian James Cahill has highlighted that Zhang Daqian sometimes asked other artists, collectors and connoisseurs to write laudatory colophons for his copies so that they could be passed off as originals.21\nThe Value of Copies\nHowever, at the end of the day, it should be noted that authentication is not just merely a case of comparison, trying to match and identify elements in order to expose a fake. The ability to authenticate a specific painting by an artist and place it in connection with the rest of his works contributes immeasurably to our understanding of the development of his practice. This, in turn, provides a more stable foundation on which to build a better understanding of Chinese art history. Lastly, it is important to keep in mind the advice of art historian Wang Yao-t’ing, who once highlighted that when confronted with a Ming copy of a Song painting, one could adopt two possible perspectives: it is a fake from the Song perspective but nevertheless, a genuine work from the Ming period.22 Hence, once the painting is returned to its proper context, there is still value in the work and much to be learnt from it.\nLow Sze Wee is Deputy Director (Heritage), Ministry of Information, Communication and the Arts.\nNotes", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/copy-after-copy-some-thoughts-on-authenticating-chinese-paintings/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/copy-after-copy-some-thoughts-on-authenticating-chinese-paintings/copy-after-copy-authenticating-chinese-paintings-1.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:51"},

This was how the Jackson Plan came to be. After Sir Stamford Raffles set up Singapore as a port, it quickly became a hotspot in the region. Trade took place in massive volumes, trade houses were built, and the culture of various communities started to take root here.\nThe increase in trade saw Singapore’s population grow more than ten-fold in just three years, exceeding the 10,000 mark by 1822. The migrant population had origins across Europe, China, South Asia, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. This surge in numbers, along with the mix of cultures on the island, led to land being used unsystematically, which strained the availability of space on the island.\nSingapore’s changing landscape\nThe Padang was a designated government area, but had houses and godowns erected on it because the Europeans and the Asian merchants preferred to set up their homes by the banks of the Singapore River. The colony, in short, was becoming disorderly and drastically different from Raffles’ original vision for the island.\nThis is a view of the Telok Ayer Bay (mid-late 19th century), an area set aside by Stamford Raffles for the Chinese community in 1822. In this photograph, two iconic structures could be seen in the distance— the old Telok Ayer market by the sea and the Thian Hock Keng temple to the left. The temple, which still stands today, was built by early Chinese immigrants in gratitude to the deity Mazu for their safe passage across the seas. Image from National Museum of Singapore.)\nRaffles was dissatisfied with Farquhar’s leadership and immediately set into motion plans to clean up the colony. In 1822, Raffles formed a Town Committee with the help of the colony’s engineer and land surveyor, Lieutenant Philip Jackson, to tackle the situation. From his personal observations of other colonial towns, such as Georgetown in Penang, he knew that a formal town plan had led to the successfully integration of Indian and Chinese immigrants. This was the solution he settled on, as it prevented groups from developing separately and creating haphazard settlements.\nThe Jackson Plan\nThe Raffles Town Plan (1822), drawn up by Sir Stamford Raffles and Lieutenant P. Jackson, together with a Town Planning Committee was aimed at curbing disorderly growth of the settlement.Using the Singapore River as a natural boundary, functional and ethnic zones were marked out. The North Bank was reserved for government use, the South Bank for finance and commercial use.The Plan also included clear instructions on the layout and design of new buildings, shophouses and streets, for example the five-foot walkways and right-angled junctions. (Image from National Archives of Singapore.)\nThe town plan, titled “Plan of the Town of Singapore”, also known as the Jackson Plan, was published in 1828. It focused on the development of the area around the Singapore River, from Telok Ayer to the Kallang River.\nAdopting features from colonial urban planning in British India, Raffles set up the seat of government in Fort Canning, similar to Calcutta’s fort-based layout. Raffles introduced ample greenery in the form of the Padang and the Botanic Gardens to give the impression of prosperity. It was also perhaps Singapore’s first step as a “Garden City”.\nDespite the failure of nutmegs at Orchard Road, there was still much interest in horticulture amongst wealthier residents in Singapore. This led to the formation of another Agri-Horticultural Society in 1859. The society’s members wanted to establish a botanical garden where they could enjoy flowers and other plants in a pleasant landscape. One founding member of the society was the prominent merchant Hoo Ah Kay, also known as Whampoa, who helped to secure a location for a botanical garden at Tanglin. This garden would later develop into the Singapore Botanic Gardens.\nGuided by pragmatism, Raffles also introduced a variety of features through the town plan which are still visible on the Singaporean landscape today. He moved Telok Ayer Market to where it is today so that it would be in the centre of the commercial district. Meanwhile, burial grounds were pushed much further inland. He mandated continuous sheltered walkways – also known as five-foot ways – meant to protect pedestrians from the hot tropical sun and rain. He also ensured that buildings were constructed with masonry and roof tiles, to reduce fire outbreaks for accessibility and safety.\nBut perhaps his most impactful mandate was the push for uniform and regular streets. He was so precise that he called for right angle intersections, indicated a minimum width for pavements and a minimum spacing in between buildings. This gave Singapore its almost grid-like layout in the heart of the city today, as evidenced by the Jubilee Trail.\nImpressive features and construction works aside, the plan was ultimately created to facilitate trading and promote communal harmony.\nEvery community would have a space to call its own.\nThe city was split according to residential, commercial or civic usage. There was also further segregation based on people’s provinces and the type of residency among citizens and merchants.\nLand segregated for different communities\nThe Government was allocated the area stretching from Fort Canning to the Singapore River. The sea beyond the Padang (labelled “Open Square” on the Jackson Plan) was also reserved for Government use. However, some places like the Old Parliament House had to be acquired by the government as it was originally built as a private home, and some other European merchants had already built houses within this area.\nThis stretch of Bussorah Street near Masjid Sultan was once known as Kampong Kaji (Pilgrim Village), kaji being the Javanese pronunciation of haji (pilgrim) as there were many Javanese living here. Until the mid-1970s, Singapore was the pilgrim hub in Southeast Asia, and pilgrims from nearby countries – in particular, Indonesia due to Dutch restrictions on the pilgrimage – would come to Singapore and stay at Bussorah Street while waiting for the kapal haj (pilgrim ship).\nThe seafront east of the cantonment to the southwest bank of the Singapore River was largely reserved for Europeans. Its actual occupants were European traders, Eurasians and rich Asians. There were also spaces for merchants in the area. When combined with the south bank of the Singapore River, reserved for commercial use, this area makes up the modern day Downtown Core.\nAnd as its name suggests, Chinese Campong (present-day Chinatown) was reserved for the Chinese, and they were allocated a large area southwest of the Singapore River. This was where Chinese laborers of different professions, such as samsui women, Chinese letter writers and wood carvers would reside.\nIndians were allocated land further up north from the Chinese in a place called Chulia Campong, but they would find themselves moving to another point north of the river. It was at this spot where a booming cattle trade saw cattle pulling bullock carts across the streets. This is Little India today.\nThe postcard depicts the junction of Chulia Street and the northwest corner of Raffles Place which was dominated for many years by the Bonham Building on the right. Chulia Street was originally known as Kling Street as large numbers of Indians from Southern India known as 'men from Kalinga' or 'orang kling' in Malay had congregated in the area. It was renamed Chulia Street as the term 'kling' adopted a deragotary association when Indian convicts were transported to Singapore. Chulia is the North Indian term for the Kalinga kingdom. c. Early 1900s. Image from National Museum of Singapore.)\nFor the Malays, the plan focused on the area around the Sultan’s residence for Bugis and Arab migrants. The area was, and is still, known as Kampong Glam, and its development resulted in the creation of three distinct parts - an area for the Sultan, one for the Bugis settlers and another for the Arab merchants.\nSense of community\nThe legacy of the Jackson Plan can still be seen on our maps today through the representation of the different ethnicities and ethnic quarters of the island, in areas such as Chinatown and Little India. Singapore is no longer divided by ethnic enclaves. What we have today is the organic mixing of communities, by the people who decided to make Singapore their home.\nBut the Jackson Plan still represents the essence of Singapore – a cosmopolitan port city where people of different communities, ethnicities and religions come together to live, work and seek opportunities for a better life.", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/becoming-a-cosmopolitan-port-city/becoming-a-cosmopolitan-port-city", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/from-a-small-port-to-a-globalised-town/from-a-small-port-to-a-globalised-town-banner.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:54"},

This gave Singapore its almost grid-like layout in the heart of the city today, as evidenced by the Jubilee Trail.\nImpressive features and construction works aside, the plan was ultimately created to facilitate trading and promote communal harmony.\nEvery community would have a space to call its own.\nThe city was split according to residential, commercial or civic usage. There was also further segregation based on people’s provinces and the type of residency among citizens and merchants.\nLand segregated for different communities\nThe Government was allocated the area stretching from Fort Canning to the Singapore River. The sea beyond the Padang (labelled “Open Square” on the Jackson Plan) was also reserved for Government use. However, some places like the Old Parliament House had to be acquired by the government as it was originally built as a private home, and some other European merchants had already built houses within this area.\nThis stretch of Bussorah Street near Masjid Sultan was once known as Kampong Kaji (Pilgrim Village), kaji being the Javanese pronunciation of haji (pilgrim) as there were many Javanese living here. Until the mid-1970s, Singapore was the pilgrim hub in Southeast Asia, and pilgrims from nearby countries – in particular, Indonesia due to Dutch restrictions on the pilgrimage – would come to Singapore and stay at Bussorah Street while waiting for the kapal haj (pilgrim ship).\nThe seafront east of the cantonment to the southwest bank of the Singapore River was largely reserved for Europeans. Its actual occupants were European traders, Eurasians and rich Asians. There were also spaces for merchants in the area. When combined with the south bank of the Singapore River, reserved for commercial use, this area makes up the modern day Downtown Core.\nAnd as its name suggests, Chinese Campong (present-day Chinatown) was reserved for the Chinese, and they were allocated a large area southwest of the Singapore River. This was where Chinese laborers of different professions, such as samsui women, Chinese letter writers and wood carvers would reside.\nIndians were allocated land further up north from the Chinese in a place called Chulia Campong, but they would find themselves moving to another point north of the river. It was at this spot where a booming cattle trade saw cattle pulling bullock carts across the streets. This is Little India today.\nThe postcard depicts the junction of Chulia Street and the northwest corner of Raffles Place which was dominated for many years by the Bonham Building on the right. Chulia Street was originally known as Kling Street as large numbers of Indians from Southern India known as 'men from Kalinga' or 'orang kling' in Malay had congregated in the area. It was renamed Chulia Street as the term 'kling' adopted a deragotary association when Indian convicts were transported to Singapore. Chulia is the North Indian term for the Kalinga kingdom. c. Early 1900s. Image from National Museum of Singapore.)\nFor the Malays, the plan focused on the area around the Sultan’s residence for Bugis and Arab migrants. The area was, and is still, known as Kampong Glam, and its development resulted in the creation of three distinct parts - an area for the Sultan, one for the Bugis settlers and another for the Arab merchants.\nSense of community\nThe legacy of the Jackson Plan can still be seen on our maps today through the representation of the different ethnicities and ethnic quarters of the island, in areas such as Chinatown and Little India. Singapore is no longer divided by ethnic enclaves. What we have today is the organic mixing of communities, by the people who decided to make Singapore their home.\nBut the Jackson Plan still represents the essence of Singapore – a cosmopolitan port city where people of different communities, ethnicities and religions come together to live, work and seek opportunities for a better life.", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/becoming-a-cosmopolitan-port-city/becoming-a-cosmopolitan-port-city", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/from-a-small-port-to-a-globalised-town/from-a-small-port-to-a-globalised-town-banner.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:56"},

TL;DR\nBefore the era of colossal skyscrapers, mega retail complexes and dense, high rise HDB flats, Singapore’s built landscape was largely dominated by quaint shophouses. Based on the Chinese courtyard house style, with modifications to suit the tropics, shophouse properties were generally constructed between the 1840s and 1960s. Over time, six distinct architectural styles, beginning with Sir Stamford Raffles’ barebones rendition, emerged.\nA pair of pintu pagar, a common shophouse feature. Such half-height outer doors offer occupants privacy and much-needed ventilation in humid Singapore. (c.2014. Image from lionraw.com)\nA defining look for the port city: Raffles’ prototype\nSir Stamford Raffles, the founder of modern Singapore, had a pretty clear idea of how he wanted the port city to look from the get-go. On November 4 1822, he issued a set of ordinances defining the building type he preferred dominating the cityscape.\nHis building stipulations served as a template for the construction of squat, two-storey units anchored by a business on the ground floor with the residence of the proprietor sited above — what we refer to as the shophouse today.\nRaffles dictated that these houses “have a verandah of a certain depth, open at all times as a continued and covered passage on each side of the street”.1 The resulting five-foot ways were intended to provide pedestrians relief from the tropical heat and protection from the rain and street traffic.2\nThe iconic five-foot way was introduced by Sir Stamford Raffles, the founder of modern Singapore. (c.2014. Image from lionraw.com)\nThis was Raffles’ take on Chinese courtyard houses.3 Settlers from the provinces of Guangdong and Fujian had brought their blueprints to Singapore.4 Raffles’ version was later replicated in city centres across the region.5 In Singapore, shophouses started appearing in the city centre in the 1840s before spreading across to other neighbourhoods over the course of a century.6\nShophouses originally served merchants and their families. This changed as large waves of immigrants moved to Singapore. In need of accommodation, shophouses soon evolved into cramped, unhygienic shared dwellings.7\n“Universal” features of a shophouse\nThe archetypal Singapore shophouse comes with five-foot ways and strong symmetry.8 It has a long and narrow floor plan, reflecting the Southern China practice of taxing buildings based on their widths.9 Shophouses typically have internal courtyards, open stairwells and skylights.10\nOvertime, six distinct typologies of shophouses emerged.\nWithin these categories, sub-design styles also surfaced. Take for instance the Chionoshire. This style is characterised by the extensive use of Chinese decorative elements such as flowers, vases with peonies, birds, cranes, peacocks, dragons, phoenixes and zodiac characters.11\nThen there is the Rococo style where almost every inch of the shophouse facade is covered with ornamentation in a layered, “wedding cake” style.12\nWestern design elements, such as Georgian style fanlights and classical mouldings in the Roman Doric style, entered the shophouse scene in the mid-1880s.13\nRudimentary and squat: the Early Shophouse style (1840s-1900s)\nThe first rendition of the shophouse was rudimentary in nature with minimal ornamentation and decorative elements. It had shutters for windows and a roof made out of locally produced clay tiles. It was a reflection of the times, when resources such as skilled labour and building materials were limited and basic at best.\nRaffles’ shophouse “prototype” rose south of the river, between South Bridge and New Bridge Roads.14 South Bridge Road was one of Singapore’s main thoroughfares which connected the town to New Harbour, present-day Keppel Harbour.15 Wholesale and retail merchant traders, as well as godowns and goldsmith shops chose to locate their businesses here to capitalise on the traffic.\nSingapore’s earliest shophouses were built along South Bridge Road. Major James Low of the Madras Army who visited Singapore during this period, wrote that he enjoyed browsing the items on sale along their “piazzas” (five-foot ways). (c. Early 20th century. Image from National Museum of Singapore)\nElegant simplicity: the First Transitional Shophouse style (early 1900s)\nNo longer a fledgling settlement, skilled labourers began pouring into Singapore. Among them were craftsmen who added decorative plasterwork and colourful tiles to the facades of shophouses, bringing a cheerier look to the city’s streets.16\nStructurally speaking, the shophouses of this era tended to be taller than their predecessors. Their timber windows were also fitted with small panels of glass.\nBy the 1900s, a second typology of shophouses emerged. This time, the units were taller and more elegant compared to the rudimentary nature of their predecessors. (c.1920s. Image from the National Museum of Singapore)\nAn exuberant riot of colours: the Late Shophouse style (1900-1940)\nThe third wave of shophouses in Singapore, known for having three instead of two windows on their upper floors, added explosions of colour and head-turning eclecticism to the streets of Singapore. Artisans, drawing inspiration from across the globe, generously adorned facades with detailed plaster, tile and cast iron ornamentation work.\nMany of these lavishly decorated shophouses were funded by people who had come into wealth during the rubber boom (1900-1930).17\nThe Late Shophouse style can be found along Emerald Hill where exuberant Peranakan tiles, decorative Corinthian columns and pilasters, full-length French windows,18 bat-motif vent openings, and carved swing-doors continue to delight residents, locals and tourists alike.19\nA 1970’s photo of a Late style shophouse at Emerald Hill Road with full-length French windows on its second floor.

Image from lionraw.com)\nShedding ornamentation: the Second Transitional Shophouse style (late 1930s)\nThe shophouses that rose during this era were more subdued. Developers dialled back on embellishments and kept colours and tiles muted, focusing instead on simple, streamlined geometric forms.\nThis could have been a matter of personal taste with the rising influence of the international Art Deco movement, or a reflection of the economic circumstances of the time as a result of The Great Depression (August 1929–March 1933).\nClean lines please: the Art Deco Shophouse Style (1930-1960)\nGeometric patterns, streamlined capitals, as well as clean arches and keystones anchor the Art Deco Shophouse Style.21\nThese shophouses are also known for their date plaques which capture the year of their completion.22\nArt Deco shophouses can be found along 486-588 Serangoon Road. These have fair-faced brickwork and symmetrical corner facades.23\nBack to basics: the Modern Shophouse Style (1950-1960)\nPragmatic design and utilitarian features are hallmarks of the Modern Shophouse style which produced more severe looking properties.\nTo improve ventilation across these spaces, builders added thin concrete fins and air vents, sticking closely to the disciplined geometric proportions of the style.\nA modern style shophouse on Race Course Road. From the Lee Kip Lin Collection. All Rights Reserved. Lee Kip Lin and National Library Board Singapore 2009.\nRoof-raising demand for shophouses\nAttesting to their timeless quality, Singapore’s shophouses can net their owners millions in the resale market.\nIn 2022, for instance, five adjoining shophouses on Club Street, in the Telok Ayer conservation area, were placed on sale for $28.5 million.24\nAgainst a limited supply, the value of these properties have been buoyed by investors eager for aesthetically pleasing and historically rooted places to pilot fresh business concepts. Among them are operators of trendy co-living spaces who have been snapping up shophouses across the city.\nYou, however, do not need deep pockets to enjoy these charming properties. The Urban Redevelopment Authority has conserved about 6,500 shophouses — a number of which are partially or fully accessible to the public.\nFor instance, a stroll through Chinatown will take you to a majestic, three-storey shophouse at the intersection of Keong Saik Road, Teck Lim Road and Jiak Chuan Road. The space is occupied by a modern F&B establishment.25\nYou can also go on a photowalk to capture the delightful pastel hues of Koon Seng Road’s shophouses, or plan a stay at a shophouse hotel in Little India or Kampong Glam.26 The ball, as they say, is in your court.\nNotes", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/singapore-shophouses/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/singapore-shophouses/chionshire-styled-shophouse-in-geylang.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:56"},

While Singapore had long existed in the centuries prior to the British arrival – as a settlement under various names such as Singapura and Temasek – it was the signing of the 1819 treaty that signalled the founding of Modern Singapore. Over the centuries, Singapore chalked up a complex history of connections with empires near and far. The inscriptions on a fragment of the Singapore Stone — part of a boulder once located at the mouth of the Singapore River — suggest that Tamil connections with Singapore go as far back as 1,000 years. (Image from the National Museum of Singapore)1\nSitting on the tip of the Malay Peninsula where sea routes intersect, the island of Singapore had long impressed mariners, traders and rulers for its strategic location, good rivers and great potential.2 The British were similarly enamoured by Singapore some centuries later. Under their charge in the 19th and 20th centuries, the ancient port was revived, attracting a melting pot of immigrants who together with founder Stamford Raffles, and British residents of Singapore William Farquhar and John Crawfurd, helped build a thriving emporium and shape the city we know today.\nAn 1817 portrait of Sir Stamford Raffles. In a bid to prevent the Dutch from monopolising trade, Raffles set about looking for a new trading base in the Malay Peninsula. (Image from the National Museum of Singapore.)\n  Spurred by Dutch pressure\nIn 1818, the Dutch set up a military post in Riau with the support of the Johor Sultanate. This move gave them control of a critical trading passage through the Strait of Malacca.3 It also gave them the liberty to impose heavy taxes on British ships at their ports.4\nThe Dutch stratagem was effective in persuading the British to relinquish control of the region, however Englishman Stamford Raffles was keen to protect British commercial interests. To this end, he embarked on a mission to hunt down a new trading base near the Malay Peninsula for the British East India Company.\nIn January 1819, a fleet of eight ships led5 by Raffles explored the possibility of hoisting the British flag on Indonesia’s Karimun islands. The islands however, proved to be too rocky.6\nOn the recommendation of hydrographer Daniel Ross, who was in charge of the party's survey ships, they made their way to Singapore.7 The island passed muster. It lay along the British trade route towards the Straits of China and boasted a natural sheltered harbour by the mouth of the Singapore River. With the notable absence of the Dutch, Raffles acted quickly to establish a trading post.8\nThis statue of Stamford Raffles has since been moved to a spot along the Singapore River where the British were believed to have landed in 1819. (c. 1905. Image from the National Museum of Singapore)\n  Securing Singapore as a trading post\nThe island’s chief, Temenggong Abdul Rahman, met with the party and was open to the idea of a British trading post. To this end, a provisional agreement was drawn up.\nSingapore, however, was part of the Johor Sultanate.9 To avoid legal disputes, Raffles needed its Malay sovereign to attach his name to the treaty. The sovereign, however, was in partnership with the Dutch.\nCapitalising on an underlying power struggle within the sultanate, Raffles brought in Tengku Hussien Shah, the rightful heir to the throne. Hussein had been unceremoniously usurped by his younger half brother. In exchange for recognition as sultan of Johor, British protection and an annual allowance, Hussien signed off on the agreement with the East India Company. 10\nThe signing ceremony was attended by islanders, as well as Malay dignitaries and British officials and soldiers dressed in their finest.11 Under the terms of this treaty, the British, sultan and temenggong were to benefit equally from the venture.\nRaffles, excited by Singapore’s prospects, famously described the island as “the most important station in the East; and, as far as naval superiority and commercial interests are concerned, of much higher value than whole continents of territory”.13\nWith the paperwork settled, Raffles left Singapore, leaving Major William Farquhar in charge as resident and commandant for four years.\nDuring these years, land was cleared for mercantile houses, roads, and other amenities to facilitate business. A hillock in Battery Road was also levelled to build Raffles Place. Subsequently, this very earth was used to fill swampy land to create Boat Quay.14\nBy 1821, the island's population had multiplied from just 1,000 inhabitants two years before to about 5,000 — attesting to the success of the trading post.\nLeft to manage Singapore on a tiny budget, Farquhar enacted a plan to curb rising crime and raise money for public works, by selling licences for the provision of vices such as gambling, alcohol and opium. 15\nIn 1822, Raffles returned. He drafted a town plan to better organise the colony. It mapped out areas for key economic activities, as well as ethnic enclaves to separately house the settlement’s diverse and disparate communities for the sake of law and order, and his vision of communal harmony.\nWilliam Farquhar, the first resident of Singapore, clashed with Raffles vis-a-vis the management of the colony. Although he played a major role in running the settlement during its critical early years, he was dismissed by Raffles in 1823.\nThis silver epergne, an ornamental centrepiece to hold fruit or flowers, was presented to William Farquhar as a parting gift from Singapore’s Chinese community in 1823, signifying his popularity among locals. (Image from the National Museum of Singapore)\nGrowing ambitions for Singapore\nThe British wanted to do more with Singapore but were held back by the terms of the 1819 treaty which they felt accorded too much power and a disproportionate amount of revenue to the temenggong and sultan.\nThey thus began nipping at their spheres of influence, eventually drawing up another treaty in August 1824 which they pressured the duo to sign. The British had the pair give up their powers and rights to the land for a lump sum pay out, raised allowances, and the permission to continue living in Singapore.\nTo further diminish their standing, the British sliced up the royal Malay area of Kampong Glam by having Victoria Street and North and South Bridge roads cut through the place.16\nThis lithograph depicts Kampong Glam and the Padang as viewed from Prinsep Hill in the 1840s. The British built a palace within a walled compound for Sultan Hussein Shah as part of the 1819 Singapore Treaty. The compound, which included burial grounds to the north, was reduced in the mid-1820s when North Bridge Road was constructed.17 (Image from the National Museum of Singapore).\nUpon the request of Sultan Hussein Shah, the British helped fund the construction of the single-storey Masjid Sultan in Kampong Glam.18 It was rebuilt (above) and completed in 1932. (Image from the National Museum of Singapore)\nThe treaty made clear that the East India Company had full control of Singapore and its surrounding islands. A separate agreement signed between the British and the Dutch in 1824 further spelled out the territorial interests of both colonial powers. It specified, for instance, that the Dutch, which had full control of the Indonesian islands, would not launch a claim on the British colony of Singapore.19\nTo mark this official handover, a 21-gun salute was fired on three islands of Singapore including Pulau Ubin.20 John Crawfurd, who took over Farquhar as resident in June 1823, sailed around Singapore on his ship for 10 days in a further display of power.21\nCrawfurd held the office of resident for about three years, sticking as closely as he could to Raffles’ ideals for the colony, while seeing through and retaining a fair number of Farquhar’s policies. Although less popular among locals than Farquhar, Crawfurd was generally regarded as an effective, prudent and conscientious administrator who successfully guided the colony’s next phase of growth and development.22 He, for instance, secured investments and helped Singapore set up a legal system.23\nIn 1826, Singapore became part of the Straits Settlements alongside territories such as Penang and Malacca.24\nThis 1827 print by Isaac Robert Cruikshank depicts John Crawfurd, the second Resident of Singapore, arresting merchant John Morgan.

Text by John Kwok\nMuseSG Volume 9 Issue 2 – Apr to Jun 2016\nEvery morning, 64-year-old (at the time of writing) Mr Quek Kim Kiang checks the tools of his trade, a pair of hooked poles, before he heads out to the mangroves. There he wades into knee-deep waters to catch mud crabs by hooking them out of their mud holes. He is careful to make sure that the crabs are not injured or broken in the process. If the crab caught is a juvenile, it goes back to the mangroves.\nAhmad Kassim, 80 years old at the time of writing, lives away from the mangroves. His home is a large wooden house that his father built during World War II. He has added a shop to his home and sells drinks to visitors. Recalling life in the village, he says, “In the past, we villagers practised gotong royong. We worked together. Neighbours came together to help each other.” Ahmad does not speak English but he understands the language of a thirsty person. The drinks he sells are not overpriced.\nThese men are part of a small community of residents who live on Pulau Ubin, Singapore’s kampong (“village” in Malay) island off the northeast coast of Singapore.\nThe story of Pulau Ubin is intimately tied to Singapore in the way of a metropolis and its frontier. The British claimed Pulau Ubin (then spelled Pulo Obin) on August 4, 1825 when John Crawfurd led an expedition to the island from Singapore, which the British had colonised only six years earlier. Crawfurd hoisted the Union Jack on the island and with a 21-gun salute, claimed Pulau Ubin and the small community of woodcutters there as part of the British Empire. Pulau Ubin was later described as an important island that commanded the entrance of the “highway for all vessels trading to China and the Far East”.\nIn an effort to combat piracy on the Johor Straits in the early 1850s, the colonial administration encouraged Malay settlers to colonise the island with tax-free land incentives to prevent pirates from using the island as a hideout. Another wave of Malay settlers came in the 1880s from the Kallang River in Singapore to settle around the coastal kampongs such as Noordin, Mamam and Petai. These settlers became fishermen.\nBy 1847, Pulau Ubin was settled by the Chinese who started private quarrying companies on the island to quarry granite and feed the demand for stone as the colony of Singapore expanded. Later in the 1850s, the colonial administration established large-scale granite quarrying operations on Pulau Ubin for the construction of the Horsburgh Lighthouse on Pedra Branca, the Raffes Lighthouse, the Causeway, Pearl’s Hill Reservoir, Fort Canning and its reservoir, and the Singapore Harbour.\nAt the turn of the 20th century, large tracts of land on the island were cleared for cash crop cultivation. Coffee, nutmeg, pineapple, coconut, tobacco and rubber plantations were opened up on the island but only rubber remained profitable. Together with granite quarrying, these became the pillars of the island’s economy. Not all the people in Ubin were involved in granite quarrying or rubber cultivation. Coffee shops and provision shops were opened across the island to cater to the needs of the quarry and plantation workers. Boat operators started ferry services to connect parts of the island together as the mangrove swamps were impassable on foot. This was an important service as the Tua Peh Kong temple, the focus of religious life on Pulau Ubin, was located at the main town on the island. It was only after the introduction of prawn farms to Pulau Ubin in the 1950s that many of the swamps were drained, linking up the different parts of Ubin and making most of the island accessible by foot.\nA Chinese festival at the Tua Peh Kong temple, 1992.\nCourtesy of National Archives of Singapore.\nA Chinese opera stage performance during the Tua Peh Kong festival, 1992.\nCourtesy of National Archives of Singapore.\nThe 1950s also marked important milestones in Pulau Ubin’s history. The first educational institution, Bin Kiang School, was established in 1952 to provide education to the island’s children, and a maternity and child health clinic was set up in 1957. Both reflected the increasing needs of the island’s growing community.\nVacated Bin Kiang School, 1992.\nCourtesy of National Archives of Singapore.\nPopulation growth on Pulau Ubin reflected the island’s economic development. In the 1970s, Pulau Ubin had a population of 2,000 to 4,000 people as granite quarrying reached its peak, due largely to the formation of the Housing & Development Board in 1960 that started large-scale housing development projects across Singapore. By the 1980s, granite quarrying operations were starting to fold up due to the drop in demand for local granite. Rubber cultivation on Pulau Ubin also declined in the 1980s as the soil was exhausted and plantations were no longer profitable to run. The loss of these economic pillars saw many people leaving the island. The population fell to 1,000 people in the late 1980s and by the mid-1990s, the population of Pulau Ubin was approximately 400. By 2001, the population fell to below 200 and it has remained that way ever since.\nPulau Ubin’s population decline and loss of economic significance should not be taken as a sign of failure. The island continues to play an important role at Singapore’s frontier. The former quarry sites have been reclaimed by nature and transformed into large lakes. The jungle and mangroves have grown into the abandoned plantations creating secondary forests and enabling wildlife to return to the island. The island is now colonised by species of bats, herons, hornbills and crabs that are no longer found in Singapore.\nPanorama of Pekan Quarry, 2014.\nCourtesy of John Kwok.\nThousands of people travel to Pulau Ubin every year, not as workers or commuting residents, but visitors who wish to experience the island’s natural and cultural heritage. They come to experience the rustic way of life – the kampong life – that can no longer be found anywhere in the metropolis. For example, the annual Tua Peh Kong festival celebrated on the island is a six-day festival featuring processions, opera performances, lion dances, mediumship and getai (live stage performances more popularly associated with the Hungry Ghost Festival). Such a long duration of celebrations is no longer practiced in Singapore. While vestiges of Pulau Ubin’s tangible past − the former maternity and child health clinic, the Tua Peh Kong temple, abandoned fish farms and quarries, and kampong houses reminds us of Ubin’s history, the stories of local residents like Mr Quek and Mr Ahmad continue the story of Pulau Ubin as the living kampong on Singapore’s frontier.\nA view of Pulau Ubin during the Tua Peh Kong Festival, 1992.\nCourtesy of National Archives of Singapore.\nView of abandoned fish farms along Jalan Ubin, near the entrance to the NParks Sensory Trail, 2015.\nCourtesy of John Kwok.\nMr Quek Kim Kiang settled in Pulau Ubin sometime in the late 1980s when the population on the island was in decline. Unlike other residents on Pulau Ubin, Mr Quek alternates between living in a house on the island and on a fishing platform anchored just off the southern coast. The fishing platform is a reminder of his past as a fisherman. These days he catches more crabs than fishes. He uses traps and hooked metal poles to catch freshwater mud crabs on the island’s mangrove swamps.\nBoat and fishing platforms just off the coast of Pulau Ubin, 2014.\nCourtesy of John Kwok.\nMr Quek is keenly aware of the impact of human activities on Ubin’s ecosystem. He recalled an incident when he encountered someone who caught a small-sized crab and he confronted him. The person responded: “If I don’t catch it, someone else will.” Mr Quek continues to catch crabs in a sustainable manner, releasing juvenile crabs that he catches that are too small back to the wild. He has also taken on a ten-year-old apprentice who is eager to learn the skills of a fisherman.\nMr Quek Kim Kiang catching crabs.\nCourtesy of John Kwok.\nMr Ahmad Kassim and his wife reside permanently on Pulau Ubin as of 2016. He arrived on the island with his father and his six siblings during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. He remembered that life during the war period was difficult and their diet consisted mainly of tapioca. That was until the Japanese offered him and his family some work and they were paid in rice. However, as Ahmad recalled: “When we got the rice, we sold it to the Chinese. We took the money and went gambling.”\nMr Ahmad prepares a coconut to be served, 2016.\nCourtesy of John Kwok.\nWhen the war ended, Ahmad remembered the Communists taking over from the Japanese on the island. They came with machine guns, pistols and bayonets. However, after a week, the British returned to the island and chased the Communists out.\nAhmad also remembers a time when his fellow villagers used to call him Ahmad Janggut: Ahmad the Bearded. As of 2016, his family and his brother’s family are the only ones left in Kampong Melayu.\nNHB’s year-long Pulau Ubin Cultural Mapping Project, concluded in April 2016, included a 25-minute documentary titled \"Life on Ubin\".

Text by Kennie Ting\nMuseSG Volume 8 Issue 2 - Jul to Sep 2015\nThe story of museums in Singapore begins with the Raffles Museum. Initiated by Raffles himself in 1823, and established in 1874 as part of a joint Raffles Library and Museum before it moved to its present Stamford Road premises in 1887, its purpose was to acquire specimens from and undertake research into Peninsular Malaya’s wealth of natural history, ethnology, and archaeology. The British believed that knowledge was power. As such, the establishment of a museum to document and research colonial territory was part and parcel of the British colonial effort, and a physical symbol of British sovereignty over alien lands. The museum’s predecessors included the Indian Museum in Calcutta and today’s National Museum of Indonesia, established by the Dutch, but briefly under Raffles’ supervision during an interregnum from 1811 to 1815 when Java was ruled by the British.\nThe earliest known photograph of the Raffles Library and Museum, 1890.\nCollection of National Museum of Singapore.\nThe Raffles Museum lost both its original purpose of being the collecting institution of the colonial apparatus and its collecting hinterland of Peninsular Malaya after Singapore attained self-government in 1959. Renamed the National Museum a year later, in 1960, it continued to flounder for the next few decades; critical questions as to what its role would be in the new nation were never satisfactorily answered. Management of the museum shifted from the Ministry of Culture to the Ministry of Science and Technology, and back again in 1972. With the latter shift, its natural history collections were excised and transferred to a brand new Singapore Science Centre and to the then-university of Singapore, where they still remain today and form the basis of the new Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum. In place of its natural history displays, the National Museum introduced a new gallery dedicated to art from Singapore and the region.\nChildren viewing an elephant exhibit in Raffles Library and Museum, 1950s.\nCollection of National Museum of Singapore.\nIt was not until the mid-1980s that the Government finally decided that it was necessary to address the National Museum’s long-term role in Singapore. A high-level Task Force on the Long-term Development of the Museum (also known as the Museum Development Committee, or MDC) was appointed by the Government to look into this. Almost concurrently, a larger Advisory Council for Culture and the Arts (ACCA) was initiated by then-Second Deputy Prime Minister, the late Dr Ong Teng Cheong. The ACCA’s mission was to review Singapore’s entire cultural landscape, and to propose a comprehensive strategy that would boost the island’s cultural vibrancy and preserve its heritage. Dr Ong wanted to turn around popular notions that Singapore was a “cultural desert”.\nThe recommendations of the MDC were eventually packaged as part of the slate of recommendations announced by the ACCA in 1989. Chief among the recommendations was a proposal to split the museum into five major standalone galleries: a Fine Arts Gallery, a Southeast Asian Natural History/Ethnology Gallery, a Singapore History Gallery, a Community Gallery, and a Children’s Museum. These galleries would be located in a “National Museum Precinct” centred around Fort Canning Hill and Bras Basah.\nThe motivation behind this proposal was the recognition that it was vital for Singapore’s continued economic success to engender in Singaporeans a deep understanding of the cultures and ways of living in the Southeast Asian region and in Singapore. Singapore’s increasingly cosmopolitan nature also made critical a deeper historical, cultural, and sociological exploration of Singapore society and identity. Moreover, the committee agreed that the existing museum premises were not large enough to accommodate works for all the new galleries, and that there was a need to expand significantly.\nThe recommendations of the ACCA were collectively implemented in the 1990s, first with the renaming of the National Museum as the Singapore History Museum in 1993. Subsequently, the Singapore Art Museum was established in 1996, at the former Saint Joseph’s Institution campus and so was the first wing of the Asian Civilisations Museum, in 1997 at the former Tao Nan School. Two other major developments took place during the same period — the first was the merging of the National Museum, the National Archives, and the Oral History Centre into the National Heritage Board (NHB) in 1993, charged to oversee the implementation of recommendations made by the ACCA pertaining to museums and cultural heritage. The second was the formation of the Museum Roundtable three years later, in 1996 — a loose association, or “coming together” of existing museums and public art galleries in Singapore. Today, the Museum Roundtable has grown organically to more than 50 members, including the National Museums, and other popular and established museums, such as the National University of Singapore Museum, the Science Centre, the Singapore Discovery Centre, the Changi Chapel and Museum, and the recently opened Art Science Museum at Marina Bay Sands.\nThe millennial decade saw an adrenaline-fuelled flurry of new developments in the museum landscape because of the Renaissance City Masterplans, which led to an emergence of a “business of museums”. This change was characterised by two paradigm shifts: the first was a recognition that museums — and the arts — were critical to urban vibrancy and quality of life, and thus an asset Singapore had to invest in in order to attract new businesses and talent; the second was to recognise museums as an industry in its own right, requiring strategies for the development of specialised capabilities such as curatorship, audience development, and object conservation.\nThere was a level of activity in the museum landscape never before seen — within the space of 10 years between 2000 to 2009, no less than 12 major museum-related milestones were achieved. These included the establishment of the Peranakan Museum, 8Q at Singapore Art Museum, and the Heritage Conservation Centre; the re-opening of the revamped National Museum of Singapore and the Asian Civilisations Museum at Empress Place; the announcements of the proposed new National Gallery of Singapore and Indian Heritage Centre; the inaugural Singapore Biennale and Singapore Night Festival; and finally, Singapore’s participation for the first time in the prestigious Venice Biennale.\nThe Heritage Conservation Centre opened in 2000\nThe Peranakan Museum opened in 2008\nEvery year during this 10-year period, Singaporeans were treated to two to three high-profile “blockbuster” exhibitions imported from major international museums including the British Museum, the Vatican Museum, the Palace Museum in the Forbidden City, and the Musée du Louvre in Paris; or exhibitions that featured major artists and prestigious private collections in Singapore and the region. These exhibitions included China Art NOW! at the Singapore Art Museum in 2001, Journey of Faith: Art & History from the Vatican Collections at the Asian Civilisations Museum in 2005, Greek Masterpieces from the Louvre at the National Museum of Singapore in 2008 and The Kangxi Emperor, Treasures from the Forbidden City at the Asian Civilisations Museum in 2009. These blockbusters were often accompanied by two to three smaller, “boutique” exhibitions that presented Singaporean art, history, and popular culture, and explored Singapore’s role as a crossroads of art, cultures, and ideas across Asia. One such example was the Beauty in Asia exhibition at the Asian Civilisations Museum in 2009, which saw the museum taking on Asia in its entirety through the medium of a single question: “What is Beauty?”. These efforts to partner regional and international counterparts as well as explore Singapore’s own culture and heritage established the museums as destinations in their own right — visitorship to the National Museums went from a few hundred thousand in the early 2000s to more than 2 million annually by the end of the decade. Total visitorship to museums in the Museum Roundtable went past the 8-million mark by the 2010s.\nLight versus Dark Exhibition: Stamps and Collectibles at the Singapore Philatelic Museum in 2013.\nTerracotta Warriors: The First Emperor and his Legacy at the Asian Civilisations Museum in 2011.\nPrincely Treasures from the House of Liechtenstein exhibition at the National Museum of Singapore in 2013.\nLooking ahead, the future looks rosy for museums in Singapore. In 2013, entry to National Museums was made free for Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents, resulting in museum visitorship figures crossing the 3-million mark that year. 2014 saw major gifts amounting to over $50 million in cash and in-kind sponsorship to the National Gallery of Singapore, as well as $46 million raised for the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum. Finally, 2015 had four new museums opening — the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum, the Indian Heritage Centre, the privately-run Singapore Pinacothèque de Paris, and the long-awaited National Gallery of Singapore. Concurrently, the National Museum of Singapore and the Asian Civilisations Museum were also undergoing major gallery revamps and re-opened their doors at the end of the year. In the meantime, the Singapore Botanic Gardens had also just been successfully inscribed as Singapore's first UNESCO World Heritage Site. All in all, there will be very vibrant and rich cultural heritage experiences for the general public in the years to come.", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/museums-in-singapore-a-short-history/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/museums-in-singapore-a-short-history/museums-in-singapore-cover.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:56"},

Text by Ian Tan Yuk Hong\nBe Muse Volume 8 Issue 1 – Apr to June 2015\nIn recent years, the display of human remains has become a topic of discussion in Western countries, particularly those with a history of colonialism. The Codes of Ethics provided by the International Council of Museums (ICOM) and the Museum Association UK offer guidelines on how to handle such collections and address questions of aims, but they are primarily intended for Western societies that deal with opposition from “people of origin” – the descendants of the people whose remains are displayed. The guidelines do not specifically address human remains at museums in regions from which they originated.\nAs a former British colony in Southeast Asia, Singapore assimilates its familiarity with Asian cultures with concepts of museum governance based on western principles. Hence, it is in a good position to reconsider how such artefacts may be treated with sensitivity.\nA Modern Framework For Handling Ancient Human Remains\nHuman remains in museums have historically been “implicated in situations of inequality”. In the United States, laws for the repatriation of human remains, such as the Native American Graves Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) of 1990, accorded indigenous communities “equal rights regarding their dead”. This paved the way for overseas communities to request for their ancestors’ remains from museums worldwide.\nIn the United Kingdom, laws allowing museum collections to be held for perpetuity were relaxed after unrelenting campaigning from such groups. Since 1995, the British Museum has received six requests from organisations - including the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre and the Museum of New Zealand - making claims on its collections of human remains.\nThe British Department for Culture, Media and Sports eventually produced guidelines for the care and return of human remains in 2005. Similar provisions were also drafted for the Museum Association UK and the American Alliance of Museums, iterating the need for a formal framework to manage human remains on display in a sensitive and culturally appropriate manner.\nThe late ICOM Code of Professional Ethics, revised and adopted in 2004, stated that the display of human remains must “take into account the interests and beliefs of members of the community, ethnic or religious groups from whom the objects originated.” The code also highlighted the possibility of “originating communities” requesting for the removal and return of such remains from public display, and how museums could address these requests “expeditiously with respect and sensitivity”. As the secretariat of ICOM Singapore, the National Heritage Board (NHB) and its member museums in Singapore must adhere to the ICOM Code of Professional Ethics.\nIn particular, the way human remains are handled in three of the NHB’s member museums in Singapore is note-worthy. The collections in the Asian Civilisation Museum (ACM), the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum, and the Department of Anatomy Museum in the National University of Singapore (NUS) are ethnographical, religious and medical in nature respectively. This allows us to see how different curatorial directions affect the treatment of human remains, and if such approaches may signal a way for other museums worldwide to follow.\nA Level-headed Approach to a Headhunting Tradition\nThe ACM is an ethnographic museum that focuses on pan-Asian cultures and civilisations, including those originating from China, Southeast Asia, South Asia and West Asia. The Dayak Carved Human Skull is the centrepiece of a permanent display showcasing the lifestyle of the indigenous Dayak tribe of Borneo. It is physical proof that the Dayaks engaged in headhunting activities, even though the practice has long been outlawed by Malaysian and Indonesian governments in Borneo.\nACM went to great lengths to assure visitors that headhunting was not a form of brutal tribal behaviour. The catalogue gave a balanced view by explaining how the Dayak tradition of headhunting was an honourable means to “improve the community’s well-being” as human heads were “believed to contain a powerful beneficial spiritual essence”. In fact human heads were treated respectfully by the Dayaks. Major rituals followed each successful headhunting expedition. Captured heads were honoured and proudly displayed in the ancestral longhouse. Elaborate swirl patterns on the skulls show that these were not merely war trophies, but revered artefacts.\nACM thus framed its curation of the Dayak human skull within an anthropological understanding of the Dayak tribe. The Dayaks are portrayed as an important component of Nusantara (Malay world). The museum also noted similarities in social structures found in some communities in Riau-Lingga sultanates, where Singapore’s Malay community draws its ancestry.\nOther museums such as Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford and the Pennsylvanian Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (Penn Museum), which also included Dayak carved skulls in its collections, treated these artefacts with similar sensitivity. In a special volume of Penn Museum’s Expedition magazine, the tribe’s practice of headhunting was described in the social context of “contributing to the prosperity of community through performance of certain important rituals, such as the Iban Dayak kenyalang, which required fresh human heads for their performance”.\nCurating The Religious Remains Of Buddha\nThe Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum serves two functions. Firstly, it honours the tooth relic and other Buddhist relics, or sarira, purportedly from Gautama Buddha. Secondly, the temple exhibits these relics and other religious artefacts in a museum setting to impart Dharma and promote awareness of the faith.\nThe relics from Buddha’s remains are venerated and enshrined in elaborate reliquaries housed in the museum’s Relics Chamber. In Buddhism, the crystal-like sarira is the embodiment of spiritual energy culminated by Buddha and eminent monks during their lifetimes, and represent a person’s “sangha” or Buddhism learning. Buddhists believe that before Buddha’s departure, he had said: “...if thou all see my relics, it would be as good as meeting in person, as good as learning the Dharma and as good as knowing nirvana.” Hence, relics associated with Buddha’s remains are highly regarded by the religion’s devotees.\nThe centrepiece of the museum, the Buddha Tooth relic, is housed in a 3.6m-high stupa made with 270kg of gold that was donated by devotees. Buddhists believe that “relics can grow and multiply”, which may be seen as not only a testament of faith, but also a departure from conventional Asian attitudes in that devotees do not view exhibiting these remains as culturally taboo. Similar beliefs are seen elsewhere: Sri Lankan Buddhists view relics enshrined in the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy as a means of receiving Buddha’s blessings and to “procure wishes for economic wealth and health.” The translocation of the Buddha Tooth from Sri Lanka to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple in Singapore is also an example of how Buddhism may be spread via the veneration of these relics.\nThe Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum and its curation of Buddha’s remains are driven by the veneration for the Buddha Tooth and sarira. Its curatorial approach also focuses on how the display of such relics represent the religion’s beliefs and their spread across Asia.\nRespecting a School’s “Silent Mentors”\nAt the Anatomy Museum (AM) in NUS, embalmed cadavers hold specific parts of the human body, which are arranged anatomically. The curatorial approach of AM may be described as that of a teaching museum founded on the educational needs of medical students and instructors.\nThe cadavers on display came from donors who had pledged their bodies for medical use after their deaths. That said, the bodies are only dissected and embalmed after a “claims” period of three years. As some facial features are still discernible, AM does not allow its handlers or viewers to take any pictures as a mark of respect. Students are also prohibited from making “Humourous and derogatory remarks” towards the cadavers. Visits to the museum must be booked ahead, and access is usually granted only to medical students and practitioners. Similar guidelines are practised in other pathology museums, including the Wellcome Museum in the Royal College of Surgeons, and The Gordon Museum in King’s College in the UK.\nUnlike the controversial Body Worlds exhibition that showed plastinated cadavers in positions mimicking horse riding, fencing and swimming, the cadavers on display in AM are treated respectfully. Cadavers come with detailed write-ups of the donors’ medical histories which highlight the museum’s emphasis on education. The museum also runs a “Silent Mentor” programme that provides information for body donation, and holds an annual ceremony to show its appreciation towards “once living individuals whose bodies are used to impart invaluable anatomical knowledge”. These practices demonstrate a unique way for treating human remains with dignity.\nPaving The Way Forward\nAcademics argue that exhibiting human remains perpetuates a “construction of otherness within an anthropological discourse that tends to privilege the visual and the spatial”. In other words, the once-living person is now viewed with a sense of detachment in the museum – not unlike an exotic artefact. Curation practices in these three Singapore museums thus demonstrate the importance of placing human remains within a larger context. From portraying headhunting as a unique ritual practised by Dayaks, to the veneration of Buddha’s relics as religious devotion, and the role of silent mentors, donated cadavers, play to students of the human body, all three museums have own a way to fulfill their respective curatorial objectives, while still according the remains with the deepest respect possible.\nIan Tan Yuk Hong is an Assistant Manager/Heritage Planning, Impact Assessment & Mitigation with the National Heritage Board", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/dignity-after-death-treating-human-remains-with-respect/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/dignity-after-death-treating-human-remains-with-respect/dignity-after-death-1.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:56"},

By Mishelle Lim, Assistant Manager, Special Projects, Singapore Philatelic Museum\nImages by Singapore Philatelic Museum\nBeMuse Volume 3 Issue 3 - Jul to Sep 2010\nFootball is widely considered the most popular sport in the world. From 11 June to 11 July 2010, people of different nations and cultures were watching the FIFA World Cup – the most prestigious and anticipated football event in the world. The previous World Cup tournament held in 2006 drew and amazing viewership of 26.3 billion.\nIn fact, the appeal of football goes back thousands of years. Archaeologists have unearthed evidence of earlier versions of football played by ancient civilisations across the globe, including Ancient Rome, Greece and China.\nCuju was played by Chinese soldiers as part of their fitness training more than 2,000 years ago. It later became a favourite game of both men and women from the upper class of Chinese society.\nAncient Greeks and Romans of both genders played ball games to keep fit.\nThe ancient Mayans of Central America enjoyed a ball game which required players to hit the ball with their shoulders, arms, shins and hips. Sometimes, the ball was substituted with the head of an unlucky enemy.\nHowever, modern football was first played in England in the 19th century. It is believed to have originated in public schools for boys as an extra-curricular activity to bring about discipline and foster team spirit.\nTHE MASS APPEAL OF MOB FOOTBALL\nIn medieval Britain and France, large-scale and often riotous ball games were popular with the masses. They were played by many players, sometimes numbering in the hundreds, with few restrictions. Divided into teams, the participants had to get the ball to its destination with their hands and feet. The unruliness of the games caused King Edward II (1284 to 1327) of England to officially ban them in 1314.\nIn 1477, King Edward IV (1442 to 1483) explicitly forbade the playing of football and other games as they were distracting the people from practising archery which was deemed a necessity in wars. Despite royal disapproval, mob football continued to be enjoyed by the people until the 19th century when a new version of the game emerged.\nTHE BIRTH OF MODERN FOOTBALL\nBritish public schools in the 19th century catered to the aristocrats and the nouveau rich. The students harboured a sense of social superiority over the staff which sometimes made controlling them a nightmare. Compulsory games were introduced to bring about some discipline and divert the excess energy of the hormonally charged teenagers. Unsurprisingly, traditional football with its chaotic and boisterous nature became popular. Games were held to improve staff-student relations, forge school unity and promote the notion of putting the institution before oneself.\nEach school had their own football rules that were at first passed down orally. The sport became more organised with the formation of houses, colours and contests. The first set of rules was written in 1846 at Rugby School in Warwickshire.\nFormer public school boys spread the game to Oxford and Cambridge when they entered university and promoted the sport in the army. Some even went on to set up their own football clubs, with each having their own rules. Some favoured a rugby style of playing while others forbade touching the ball with the hands. During matches, the first half of the game could be played under the rules favoured by one club while the second half would adhere to the rules of the other club.\nResearchers have found that organised football matches were held outside the world of public schools as well. These games, which often involved betting, took place all over Britain.\nIn 1862, representatives of leading football clubs met to standardise the football rules. Those who preferred a dribbling version of the game set up the Football Association (FA) on 26 October 1863. Those who favoured a rugby-like version withdrew from the meeting and went on to form the Rugby Football Union in 1871. Football, as we know it today, became referred to as association football. The FA Cup, launched in 1871, is the oldest national football competition. Today, the rules of the game are determined by the International Football Association Board.\nKICKING OFF EVERYWHERE\nFootball quickly found its place in rapidly industrialising Britain. Men from all social classes enjoyed it and played against one another. The football pitch became a legitimate venue for the working class to take a shot at the elite. Football had even begun to surpass the popularity of rugby. One of the reasons was that it was just as masculine but less rough than rugby. Young men simply could not afford to be absent from work due to injuries! Britons who travelled overseas, especially to parts of the British Empire, brought the game with them. As the popularity of football grew, particularly in Europe and South America, other countries began to set up their own football associations.\nBIRTH OF THE WORLD CUP\nIn the early 1900s, some national football associations wanted to create an international body to discuss the future of football. They were interested in organising an international football competition. As a result, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association, or FIFA, was formed in 1904. Its founding members were France, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.\nJules Rimet (1873-1959): The longest serving President of FIFA, having headed the organization from 1921 to 1954. The French lawyer is credited as the man who made the World Cup a reality.\nFIFA held the first World Cup in Uruguay in 1930. Since then, FIFA has organised a World Cup tournament every four years, with the exceptions of 1942 and 1946 due to World War II. The 2010 World Cup attracted a record 205 national teams in the preliminary rounds, with 32 countries vying for the crown in the finals in South Africa.\nThis set of special velvet stamps was issued by Singapore in 2004 to commemorate the 100th Anniversary of FIFA.\nStamp of 2002 World Cup Korea and Japan.\nFOOTBALL IN SINGAPORE\nIn the late 19th century, the British in Singapore formed sporting clubs and regularly competed against one another. The first football match recorded on the island was played in 1889 by British engineers at a pitch in Tank Road. The game was subsequently introduced to British subjects and students in British schools, before it became a favourite sport among the locals.\nA predecessor of the Football Association of Singapore, the Singapore Amateur Football Association (SAFA) was registered in 1892. Formed 29 years after the Football Association in England, it is possibly the oldest football association in Asia. The SAFA held the first Singapore Football League in 1904. The early football scene in Singapore was dominated by Europeans. But by the 1920s, local teams such as the Singapore Chinese Football Association and the Singapore Malays Football Association began to make their mark. They often competed with overseas teams to packed stadiums. Once, the best players from both associations literally brought the house down when they beat Australia 4-2 at Anson Road Stadium.\nA visiting football team known as the 'Colombo Barefooters' played against the Singapore Chinese team in 1928 | Collection of Singapore Sports Council, courtesy of National Archives of Singapore\n\"Singapore’s passion for football never waned, even when the threat of war loomed. In 1941, the island’s team beat Penang to clinch the Malaysia Cup for the fourteenth time. The Malaysia Cup was one of the most anticipated football competitions in Singapore. It was started in 1921 as the Malaya Cup by officers of the British battleship, HMS Malaya. Many Singaporeans still remember the days when the whole nation would put aside whatever it was doing to cheer for the national team, fondly called ‘the Lions’.\"\nAt the National Stadium in Kallang, the Lions' victory and the cheer of the fans gave rise to the term 'the Kallang Road' | Collection of Ministry of Information, Communication and the Arts, courtesy of National Archives of Singapore\nHowever, 1994 was the last year Singapore won the Malaysia Cup. In 1995, Singapore’s football administrators withdrew from the tournament to focus on developing its own league. This did not sit well with local fans. Nevertheless, the S.League was born in 1996.

Text by John Kwok\nMuseSG Volume 9 Issue 2 – Apr to Jun 2016\nEvery morning, 64-year-old (at the time of writing) Mr Quek Kim Kiang checks the tools of his trade, a pair of hooked poles, before he heads out to the mangroves. There he wades into knee-deep waters to catch mud crabs by hooking them out of their mud holes. He is careful to make sure that the crabs are not injured or broken in the process. If the crab caught is a juvenile, it goes back to the mangroves.\nAhmad Kassim, 80 years old at the time of writing, lives away from the mangroves. His home is a large wooden house that his father built during World War II. He has added a shop to his home and sells drinks to visitors. Recalling life in the village, he says, “In the past, we villagers practised gotong royong. We worked together. Neighbours came together to help each other.” Ahmad does not speak English but he understands the language of a thirsty person. The drinks he sells are not overpriced.\nThese men are part of a small community of residents who live on Pulau Ubin, Singapore’s kampong (“village” in Malay) island off the northeast coast of Singapore.\nThe story of Pulau Ubin is intimately tied to Singapore in the way of a metropolis and its frontier. The British claimed Pulau Ubin (then spelled Pulo Obin) on August 4, 1825 when John Crawfurd led an expedition to the island from Singapore, which the British had colonised only six years earlier. Crawfurd hoisted the Union Jack on the island and with a 21-gun salute, claimed Pulau Ubin and the small community of woodcutters there as part of the British Empire. Pulau Ubin was later described as an important island that commanded the entrance of the “highway for all vessels trading to China and the Far East”.\nIn an effort to combat piracy on the Johor Straits in the early 1850s, the colonial administration encouraged Malay settlers to colonise the island with tax-free land incentives to prevent pirates from using the island as a hideout. Another wave of Malay settlers came in the 1880s from the Kallang River in Singapore to settle around the coastal kampongs such as Noordin, Mamam and Petai. These settlers became fishermen.\nBy 1847, Pulau Ubin was settled by the Chinese who started private quarrying companies on the island to quarry granite and feed the demand for stone as the colony of Singapore expanded. Later in the 1850s, the colonial administration established large-scale granite quarrying operations on Pulau Ubin for the construction of the Horsburgh Lighthouse on Pedra Branca, the Raffes Lighthouse, the Causeway, Pearl’s Hill Reservoir, Fort Canning and its reservoir, and the Singapore Harbour.\nAt the turn of the 20th century, large tracts of land on the island were cleared for cash crop cultivation. Coffee, nutmeg, pineapple, coconut, tobacco and rubber plantations were opened up on the island but only rubber remained profitable. Together with granite quarrying, these became the pillars of the island’s economy. Not all the people in Ubin were involved in granite quarrying or rubber cultivation. Coffee shops and provision shops were opened across the island to cater to the needs of the quarry and plantation workers. Boat operators started ferry services to connect parts of the island together as the mangrove swamps were impassable on foot. This was an important service as the Tua Peh Kong temple, the focus of religious life on Pulau Ubin, was located at the main town on the island. It was only after the introduction of prawn farms to Pulau Ubin in the 1950s that many of the swamps were drained, linking up the different parts of Ubin and making most of the island accessible by foot.\nA Chinese festival at the Tua Peh Kong temple, 1992.\nCourtesy of National Archives of Singapore.\nA Chinese opera stage performance during the Tua Peh Kong festival, 1992.\nCourtesy of National Archives of Singapore.\nThe 1950s also marked important milestones in Pulau Ubin’s history. The first educational institution, Bin Kiang School, was established in 1952 to provide education to the island’s children, and a maternity and child health clinic was set up in 1957. Both reflected the increasing needs of the island’s growing community.\nVacated Bin Kiang School, 1992.\nCourtesy of National Archives of Singapore.\nPopulation growth on Pulau Ubin reflected the island’s economic development. In the 1970s, Pulau Ubin had a population of 2,000 to 4,000 people as granite quarrying reached its peak, due largely to the formation of the Housing & Development Board in 1960 that started large-scale housing development projects across Singapore. By the 1980s, granite quarrying operations were starting to fold up due to the drop in demand for local granite. Rubber cultivation on Pulau Ubin also declined in the 1980s as the soil was exhausted and plantations were no longer profitable to run. The loss of these economic pillars saw many people leaving the island. The population fell to 1,000 people in the late 1980s and by the mid-1990s, the population of Pulau Ubin was approximately 400. By 2001, the population fell to below 200 and it has remained that way ever since.\nPulau Ubin’s population decline and loss of economic significance should not be taken as a sign of failure. The island continues to play an important role at Singapore’s frontier. The former quarry sites have been reclaimed by nature and transformed into large lakes. The jungle and mangroves have grown into the abandoned plantations creating secondary forests and enabling wildlife to return to the island. The island is now colonised by species of bats, herons, hornbills and crabs that are no longer found in Singapore.\nPanorama of Pekan Quarry, 2014.\nCourtesy of John Kwok.\nThousands of people travel to Pulau Ubin every year, not as workers or commuting residents, but visitors who wish to experience the island’s natural and cultural heritage. They come to experience the rustic way of life – the kampong life – that can no longer be found anywhere in the metropolis. For example, the annual Tua Peh Kong festival celebrated on the island is a six-day festival featuring processions, opera performances, lion dances, mediumship and getai (live stage performances more popularly associated with the Hungry Ghost Festival). Such a long duration of celebrations is no longer practiced in Singapore. While vestiges of Pulau Ubin’s tangible past − the former maternity and child health clinic, the Tua Peh Kong temple, abandoned fish farms and quarries, and kampong houses reminds us of Ubin’s history, the stories of local residents like Mr Quek and Mr Ahmad continue the story of Pulau Ubin as the living kampong on Singapore’s frontier.\nA view of Pulau Ubin during the Tua Peh Kong Festival, 1992.\nCourtesy of National Archives of Singapore.\nView of abandoned fish farms along Jalan Ubin, near the entrance to the NParks Sensory Trail, 2015.\nCourtesy of John Kwok.\nMr Quek Kim Kiang settled in Pulau Ubin sometime in the late 1980s when the population on the island was in decline. Unlike other residents on Pulau Ubin, Mr Quek alternates between living in a house on the island and on a fishing platform anchored just off the southern coast. The fishing platform is a reminder of his past as a fisherman. These days he catches more crabs than fishes. He uses traps and hooked metal poles to catch freshwater mud crabs on the island’s mangrove swamps.\nBoat and fishing platforms just off the coast of Pulau Ubin, 2014.\nCourtesy of John Kwok.\nMr Quek is keenly aware of the impact of human activities on Ubin’s ecosystem. He recalled an incident when he encountered someone who caught a small-sized crab and he confronted him. The person responded: “If I don’t catch it, someone else will.” Mr Quek continues to catch crabs in a sustainable manner, releasing juvenile crabs that he catches that are too small back to the wild. He has also taken on a ten-year-old apprentice who is eager to learn the skills of a fisherman.\nMr Quek Kim Kiang catching crabs.\nCourtesy of John Kwok.\nMr Ahmad Kassim and his wife reside permanently on Pulau Ubin as of 2016. He arrived on the island with his father and his six siblings during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. He remembered that life during the war period was difficult and their diet consisted mainly of tapioca. That was until the Japanese offered him and his family some work and they were paid in rice. However, as Ahmad recalled: “When we got the rice, we sold it to the Chinese. We took the money and went gambling.”\nMr Ahmad prepares a coconut to be served, 2016.\nCourtesy of John Kwok.\nWhen the war ended, Ahmad remembered the Communists taking over from the Japanese on the island. They came with machine guns, pistols and bayonets. However, after a week, the British returned to the island and chased the Communists out.\nAhmad also remembers a time when his fellow villagers used to call him Ahmad Janggut: Ahmad the Bearded. As of 2016, his family and his brother’s family are the only ones left in Kampong Melayu.\nNHB’s year-long Pulau Ubin Cultural Mapping Project, concluded in April 2016, included a 25-minute documentary titled \"Life on Ubin\".

The artist has included several well-known landmarks such as the tower of St. John’s Cathedral, seen above the smaller paddle steamer and the Government House, uphill to its right. A great variety of vessels are present in the harbour, including a coastal junk, Tanka boats operated by blue-robed “Boat Dwellers” (native ethnic minorities of Southern China), covered hulks (obsolete sailing ships converted for use as naval base), small side wheelers, and three-masted sailing ships flying the flags of Britain, France and the United States. The first views of Hong Kong, such as this example, began to appear in the early 19th century. The British built their first city on the island of Hong Kong and called it Victoria city (presently Sheung Wan and Sai Wan districts). The name “Victoria” demonstrated the extent of rule and authority of the British government. As Hong Kong grew in stature as a British crown colony, such paintings became an important record of the development of the port and the increasing volume of international ships that called to port.Beyond the great number of vessels that visited the important Hong Kong harbour, lies a curiosity in the presence of a junk-rigged vessel with additional jib and topsails in Western fashion. The adapted design of the ship illustrates the pluralistic nature of interactions within cosmopolitan harbours. The port was a gate way of cross-cultural interaction between the East and the West, and demonstrates artistic and cultural exchange between China and the world.Such paintings were known as China trade paintings, and were popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. Produced largely for visiting tourists and foreign traders, the paintings were executed by local and foreign artists, working in a Western style in order to appeal to the market. Art studios were set up in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, where mass-produced genre scenes of treaty ports, portraits and still lifes were sold as souvenirs. While China trade paintings found a huge market at that time, the growing popularity of photography in the late 19th century shifted this demand pattern, eventually rendering such trade paintings obsolete.", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/Collection-Landing/listing/1342321", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/CollectionImages/1342321.jpg", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:57"},

TL;DR\nHow did children of yesteryear keep themselves occupied? They were pretty resourceful and inventive. If they lacked a jump rope, they fashioned one out of rubber bands. Traditional games such as this were often inexpensive and easy to make. Brought to life by creative minds, a plethora of games emerged over time, capturing imaginations and unifying communities across playgrounds and open spaces islandwide. Try out some of these games for yourself!\nThis write-up was adapted from an educational booklet produced by the Malay Heritage Centre.\nYeh-Yeh (Jump Rope)\nWhile the origins of jump rope are fuzzy — some believe it started in Egypt while others trace it back to ancient China1 — one thing is for certain: jump rope crosses cultures and has entertained children for millenia. It is as much a staple activity for African American girls in modern times, as it was for children of Medieval Europe who used to jump rope on its streets.2\nJump ropes can be made from a range of materials. The ancient Egyptians were said to have used vines while children in more recent times repurpose items such as clothes lines and twine. In Singapore, children used to string together rubber bands in a game some refer to as yeh-yeh.\nTry it yourself:\nTwo individuals hold a piece of rope on each end. Then they swing it. A third player jumps over it.\nAs the game progresses, the rope is raised higher and higher until the player can no longer jump over the rope without touching it.\nSome versions of the game specify six heights to clear, starting at the ground level, then the ankles, knees, waists, shoulders and ears of the individuals holding the rope.3\nThe player who clears the rope at its highest point wins.\nTo add yet another dimension to the activity, two ropes can be put in play and whipped around while a player attempts to slip in between the lines and clear them. Rhythms and chants can also be added to enhance gameplay.\nGasing (spinning top)\nThe top has fascinated both the young and old for centuries. Archaeological digs across the world have uncovered tops fashioned out of a variety of materials including conch shells, seed pods, ivory and iron.4\nCloser to home, the game’s popularity has been traced back to the 15th century during the reign of the Melakan Sultanate. Records show that the gasing served as entertainment for rice farmers who played it during lull periods after the end of the harvest season.5\nThe shape of the gasing was said to have been inspired by the fruit of the berembang tree which tapered off at its tip.6 It tended to do well on hard and sandy surfaces.7 In Singapore, gasing was played across kampongs islandwide.\nTry it yourself:\nTops are designed to spin rapidly while balanced on their tips. All it takes is a simple flick of the wrist to set the top in motion. Others might need to be wound up via a string around their axis and then released quickly. The player who can keep his or her top spinning the longest, or strike and stop the trajectory of another top in play, wins.\nTie a string tightly around the top of the gasing.\nThrow the gasing and release the string at the same time. Carefully transfer the top onto a wooden panel.\nIn another version of the game, players have to strike and topple each other’s tops. The gasing that survives or spins the longest, wins.\nCapteh\nWith acrobatic hurricane-whirl kicks and mesmerising moves inspired by natural predators such as the snake, tiger and leopard, the Shaolin monks are renowned as impressive martial artists. What few would believe is that generations of them had used the humble shuttlecock — or capteh as we know it — to sharpen and hone their kung fu skills.8\nIt might seem like child’s play to get the shuttlecock off the ground but mastering special moves and keeping it airborne for as long as possible with one’s feet is a whole other ball game. An international federation has evolved the game into a competitive sport since 1999, with players battling it out on a court with a net in the middle to challenge their agility, balance and strength.\nThe capteh played in our neck of the woods tends to be a more casual activity. Looks-wise, it is hard to miss. It typically comprises rainbow hued feathers attached to a weighted, rubber sole.\nTry it yourself:\nLaunch the capteh into the air with one foot and keep it off the ground for as long as possible using either foot. A point is awarded for every successful kick.\nThe objective is to keep this going for as long as possible without using one’s hands.\nIt is a numbers game with capteh. The more kicks executed to keep it in the air, the higher the chance of winning. Players can also agree on a winning tally of continuous kicks to sieve out the winner.\nCapteh can also be a team sport. In this iteration, participants form a circle. The first player then steps into its centre to demonstrate his capteh abilities. A second player takes over and so forth until all players have completed their turn. The team with the most number of kicks wins.\nBatu Seremban (five stones)\nSoft little pads of beans, rice or sand wrapped in cloth. Some handsewn, some mass manufactured. The game of batu seremban or five stones, where the objective is to catch counters thrown into the air, has enthralled children for generations.\nThe game, which requires hand-eye coordination and a certain level of dexterity to clear its various levels, is not unique to the region. Researchers have found evidence of it being played in ancient Greece and Ukraine.11\nTry it yourself:\nThrow the five stones on the ground. Then pick one up to toss in the air.\nWith the same hand, pick up a second stone from the ground and catch the first stone before it touches the ground.\nNow, with two stones in hand, toss one of the stones into the air and pick up a third stone from the ground.\nNext, throw one of the three stones in hand into the air, pick up a fourth stone from the ground and retrieve the falling, airborne stone.\nFinally, throw the fourth stone into the air and pick up the final stone on the ground.\nThere are multiple levels to the game, each with increasing complexity and variants of gameplay that involve multiple players. Many Singaporeans would have fond memories of casual or competitive sessions of five stones during their days as students.\nGoli\nGoli or marbles is a riveting game. At stake are your own marbles which you bring to the arena. Using one’s own set of glass balls, players gingerly flick, nudge and prod competitor’s marbles away from pre-determined margins — usually a circle drawn in the sand or demarcated by string.\nThe game requires patience, skill and accuracy to control the trajectory of the marbles and successfully strike a competitor's token out of the play zone.\nTry it yourself:\nDraw a circle on the ground. Thereafter, get each player to place one of their marbles in the play zone.\nTo start the game, add two parallel lines to the ground. Players should then take turns to each throw a marble from behind one of the lines (A).\nThe player whose marble is nearest to the line on the other end (i.e. line B), gets to start the game.\nGame play starts from line B. Each player takes turns to throw their marbles into the circle with the aim of dislodging those belonging to their competitors.\nThe player gets to keep the marble he or she successfully edges out of the circle. The participant who collects the most marbles wins.\nCongkak\nCongkak, a two-player game akin to chess, requires a fair bit of mental agility and mathematical prowess to anticipate moves and game play patterns. The game’s objective is to amass the larger number of seeds in your own stipulated storehouse on the board.\nThe board itself, typically boat-shaped with 16 hollowed out pits, deserves a mention. Early editions used to be hand carved12 and made out of expensive woods such as mahogany or teak. More exquisite sets would feature intricate carvings of dragons or mythical birds. Cowrie shells, marbles as well as saga or tamarind seeds can be used to plug the board’s holes.\nVariations of the game, which is said to have originated in the Middle East, in particular Jordan between 7,000 BC and 5,000 BC, are played all over the globe, having been spread by travellers and traders over time.13\nHow it's played:\nTwo players sit across each other with the boat-shaped block in between.\nEach player “owns” the circular holes before them (henceforth known as homes), as well as the larger pit on his or her left.\nBefore the game begins, each house must be filled with seven marbles. Both storehouses are left empty.\nBoth players then pick up marbles from any of their own houses. Going clockwise, they deposit a marble per house on the board, regardless of who owns the house, until the marbles in hand run out.\nThey must also deposit a marble at their own storehouses but not at their opponent's before ending the round.\nUpon ending the round, a player scoops up all the seeds in the house he dropped his last seed in, and repeats the process until his last seed lands in an empty house.\nThere are three outcomes for each player at the end of these rounds:\n- If the last seed falls into his own house, he can pick all the seeds from his opponent’s house lying across it and deposit them in his own storehouse.\n- If it drops into his storehouse, he can continue the game, picking a house of his choice from his side to begin the next round.\n- Should his last seed end up in an empty house, he is considered ”dead” and his turn ends.\nThe one with the most seeds at the end wins. This round is followed by two others which vary in play.\n  Source: Let’s Play – Traditional Malay Games @ Malay Heritage Centre (pamphlet)\nNotes", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/are-you-game-how-we-used-to-play/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/traditional-malay-games/traditional-games-for-web.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:57"},

The temple relocated to its current location in the 1990s.\nKeat Sun Beo was established in 1898 at Lorong Chuan by Hokkien immigrants with the surname “Tan”. It functioned as a family shrine for the Tans before opening up to devotees from other clans and dialect groups. Aside from its religious functions, the temple also disburses bursaries to needy students living in the Hougang area.\nChao Ying Kong, the newest temple of the three, was established in 1988 in Yishun with incense ash brought from the mother temple of the same name in Nan An, Fujian by the temple’s leaders. Today, the temple continues to maintain a strong relationship with the mother temple in China through exchange visits.\nFrom National Monuments to memories of diverse communities who call Hougang home, these three thematic trails are designed to bring you on a journey of discovery.

It is an enormous land mass rich in geographic and cultural diversity, populated by peoples whose histories date to ancient times. Interactions between its innumerable ethnic groups have created remarkably rich traditions as well as an artistic heritage filled with history and symbolism. Yet whether in terms of size, population or cultural diversity, Africa remains an emotionally foreign location to most Singaporeans.\nJointly organised by the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) and the musée du quai Branly (MQB), Paris, Congo River: Arts of Central Africa marked the first showcase of MQB's African collections in Singapore – the result of a Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2009 to intensify cultural cooperation and exchanges between France and Singapore. This jointly organised exhibition ran for four months from 10 December 2010 to 10 April 2011. Featuring over 100 sculptures, masks and other beautifully crafted objects from well known institutions such as musée du quai Branly, Paris; Royal Museum for Central Africa, Tervuren; the National Museum of Ethnology, Leiden and musée national Picasso, Paris, the exhibition was a once-in-a-lifetime visual feast for our visitors and an opportunity to experience the rich artistic traditions behind these masterpieces.\nMask, Songye, Democratic Republic of Congo, 20th century, Collection of musée du quai Branly. Gift of Webster Plass.\nThe continent of Africa is dominated by two immense rivers, the Nile and the Congo. Winding for 4,700 kilometres through central Africa, the Congo River passes through many different landscapes, from lush equatorial forests in the north to broad savannahs in the south. For thousands of years, the Congo River has also connected people; as the river carried goods and trade, it also linked culture and art. The majority of the people living around the Congo River and the nearby Ogooué River speak the Bantu family of languages.\nDating back to more than 3000 years ago, the Bantu-speaking people migrated southward into central Africa from Nigeria. There were two large waves which resulted in one of the most significant mass migrations and cultural transmissions in human history. The geographical environments where these people settled down often shaped their perception of the world, expressed through their politics, traditions and belief systems. Powerful kingdoms ruled the open savannahs, such as the celebrated Kongo kingdom; whilst independent groups such as the Fang and Kota lived in dense equatorial forests, governed by lineage groups or communal organisations. In spite of localised differences, these peoples remained tied together not only by the Bantu language, but also in certain commonalities in their art.\nMap of Congo in Africa\nThe exhibition Congo River: Arts of Central Africa explored the common artistic heritage of the Bantu-speaking peoples in three broad themes: face masks shaped generally like hearts; statues of ancestors; and the representation of females. The exhibition also included a section on African art’s impact on the larger world. In the late 19th century, European collectors and artists were struck by the visual power of African sculpture. The stylised human forms found in Congo sculptures inspired leading artists to venture beyond naturalism. One such artist was Pablo Picasso (1881-1973), who avidly collected African art. A selection of his works was presented in the exhibition to allow visitors to witness Africa’s influence in the development of Picasso’s Modernist style.\nMasks in the Form Of Hearts\nMasks in the general shape of a heart can be found all along the Congo River and the Ogooué River to the west. Such masks, mainly of wood or ivory, are usually made by communities living in equatorial rainforests. The forehead and cheeks frame a heart-shaped space that is usually painted white, a colour associated with the realm of ancestors. The white pigment, called mpemba, is made from powdered kaolin, a white clay collected from riverbanks.\nA mask would usually be worn at rituals and performances, together with a costume made of leaves, vegetable fibres or textiles. Performances would be accompanied by chants and music. Masked dances were not just entertainment but also served to teach moral values, unify a community, drive away evil spirits, cure sickness, or carry out justice. The wearer of a mask could be transformed into another being associated with supernatural spirits, such as ancestors, heroes or nature. Masked performances were usually carried out during rites of passage (when children become adults, or elders become ancestors) or during ceremonies marking the passage of time or the agricultural cycle.\nOne highlight in this section was a Kwele mask framed by a pair of long animal horns, representative of benign forest spirits known as ekuk. The horns may be those of the antelope – an important game animal for the Kwele. A skilled sculptor used empty spaces and faceted surfaces to give depth and complexity to the mask. The Kwele associated the forest with the world of spirits or ekuk, who acted as intermediaries between the village and spiritual world. The white paint on the masks was associated with light and clarity, forces that symbolised the ekuk’s ethereal nature and ability to combat evil spirits. As supernatural beings, ekuk were above mortal concerns and could settle disputes amongst villagers.\nMask with Encircling Horns, Kwele, Gabon, Early 20th century, Collection of musée du quai Branly, Gift of Dr Pautchenko, © musée du quai Branly, photo Sandrine Expilly.\nThese ekuk masks were used during village ceremonies known as beete that were held in times of need to unify the village against a crisis, like poor hunting or an epidemic. A variety of dances were held during the beete ceremony. In some, the audience participated to foster a sense of unity. Before the ceremonies, young men would hunt, another activity promoting camaraderie. At the end of the ritual, antelope meat and intestines contributed to a ritual stew that was consumed by the whole village.\nAs such, African masks and other artworks had a utilitarian purpose in daily life. They were not art made for art’s sake, but played a vital role in the fate of the individual and the community. An effective object could secure a successful crop, appear at funerals to comfort the grieving, avert evil forces, or serve as entertainment. Such functionality differentiated African art from a Western understanding of art, which prioritised form and visual aesthetic. African art, by and large, was intricately connected to and widely used in all aspects of daily life. In their original context, these objects were replaced by new ones when they became worn. Sadly, many of the traditions recorded by historians and anthropologists may have faded today. No one can be sure if these activities and rituals are still practised in those parts of Africa. Many of them would be meaningless in present-day Africa whilst some have found new purpose in recent times.\nThe disc mask from the Teke-Tsaayi community, a model of the versatility and extreme abstraction of a human face, is an example of a mask that has lost its original context of use and taken on a new mantle in its rebirth. In its original context, this mask was worn for kidumu dances that were performed to ceremonially assert and maintain the group’s social and political structures. The mask is divided into two parts at eye level. The upper part protrudes slightly outwards, with narrow slits for the eyes on either side of the small nose to allow the dancer to see. The masked dancers also wore a ring of feathers and a collar of raffia fibre. Often the dancers were young men who performed strenuous acrobatic dances that included cartwheels.\nKidumu dance declined when French colonial powers began moving into the upper Ogooué region at the beginning of the 20th century and people converted to Christianity. Yet in 1963, the dance was recreated with newly made masks to celebrate the inauguration of a railway line. Since then, the kidumu dance has been held for entertainment, and new masks have been made using traditional as well as new designs.\nAncestor Veneration\nAncestor veneration is an important element of central African culture. Vested with mystical powers and authority, ancestors could be called upon to look after their living descendants. Various communities preserved the remains of prominent ancestors – chiefs, warriors, mothers and formidable women – which were stored in bark boxes, woven baskets, or in the cavities of wooden figures. The Fang peoples of Gabon produced among the best-known and highly regarded examples of this genre. Both northern and southern Fang styles are evident in the exhibition: the northern Fang only carved full standing figures, while southern Fang styles have an imposing head with ornate coiffure.\nIn rituals to honour ancestors, Fang reliquary figures were placed on top of bark cylindrical boxes containing the skulls and bones of revered ancestors. The bones were thought to provide power, wealth and protection to the clan by retaining the deceased’s spiritual essence and serving as a tangible medium for communicating with their spirits. The number of skulls showed the quality of the clan’s lineage; a greater number of skulls signalled an older lineage and more power wielded. The reliquary tradition is a testament to the Fang’s migratory history, as their itinerant existence made permanent ancestral gravesites impossible and necessitated a portable version of ancestral shrines. The variety in form, detail and surface treatment of Fang reliquaries indicate the cultural assimilation that occurred as a result of their contact and conflict with neighbouring peoples.\nReliquary Figure, Fang, Gabon, 20th century, Collection of musée du quai Branly, © musée du quai Branly, photo Michel Urtado, Thierry Ollivier.\nAncestor figures were also carved by some communities to emphasise family continuity, community bonds, and the claims of chiefs to power. Of special note were the Kota reliquary figures used in ancestral veneration: the reliquaries were placed on baskets that held the bones of deceased relatives, serving as their guardians. The Fang Byeri and Kota Bwete associations were responsible for honouring the family or clan’s most important ancestors, who were often leaders, courageous warriors, superior craftsmen, village founders, fertile women, and individuals with special talents. However, Kota reliquaries were personalised in terms of being owned by a particular family, named, and identified with certain powers. They were also considerably more abstracted than Fang reliquaries, representing the human figure on a flat, planar surface and enveloping it in costly copper or brass sheeting that reflected the importance of the ancestor being honoured. The shine on the metal plating reflected or “threw back” evil. Brass was a precious material in central Africa because it was mainly acquired through trade with Europeans, and served as a form of currency. Kota reliquary figures were among the earliest African artefacts exhibited in France in the late 19th century. Their radically stylised depictions of the human form had a tremendous influence on the development of Western art.\n20th century, Collection of musée du quai Branly, Gift of Léon Guiral, © musée du quai Branly, photo Thierry Ollivier, Michel Urtado.\nCompared to the representation of ancestors, the representation of rulers in sculpture was rarer, occurring primarily in the royal arts of sub-Saharan African courts, such as the Kuba kingdom in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Remarkable Kuba king figures, known as ndop, were believed to house the counterpart to the king’s soul and served as his surrogate in his absence. Once thought to be literal portraits of specific Kuba rulers, the ndop were actually conventionalised representations, some of which were sculpted posthumously. Their identities were depicted through distinguishing attributes. A key identifying insignia was carved in front of the dais of each statue, such as an anvil or gameboard, which represented a particular characteristic of the ruler’s reign. The exhibition presents the ndop of Miko mi-Mbul of Mushenge, the 110th Kuba king, who lived in the early 19th century. His royal insignia is a human figure. The principal feature of this king’s reign was a change in social customs, when he legalised marriage with slave women. Kuba ndop, like other royal arts, served as a locus of authority, identifying the elite and conveying messages of power to their subjects. Viewers recognised the ndop as a royal personage through its iconography, such as Miko mi-Mbul’s cross-legged pose, the cowrie-ornamented belt, or brass armbands worn only by royalty. Believed to be the embodiment of the king’s and his ancestors’ spirits, ndop were carefully conserved and venerated by following generations. The practice of carving ndop may have been introduced by a Kuba ruler in the 18th century to replace the worship of nature spirits, therefore uniting his subjects by concentrating their loyalty in the person of the king. Thus, although the Kuba did not have a cult of the ancestor in the same vein as the Fang or Kota, certain similarities between the two practices are evident.\nFemale Representation\nIn terms of representation, whether in royal arts or other genres in African art, the image of the female was widespread in certain cultural groups. In the cultures of the savannah, women play important roles as rulers, priestesses, honoured mothers and powerful ancestors. The high status of women among the Bantu-speaking peoples is also shown in the principle of matrilineal descent, or the inheritance of leadership through the female line.\nThe Luba people – whose economic and political power spread their culture to neighbouring groups, such as the Hemba – were renowned for extensively depicting women in their art. This reflected the high status of women in Luba society and government. In Luba caryatid stools, female figures commonly made up the supporting structure, balancing the sitter on her head and palms. Only the king owned a caryatid stool and had the right to sit during ceremonies. The stool was otherwise hidden in another village when not in use, wrapped in white cloth and guarded to avoid theft or tampering. It was a highly spiritual and symbolic object, not for everyday use, but only brought out for special occasions. The female caryatid represented the female founder, symbolically connecting the current ruler to his ancestors.\nAs the line of ancestral continuity occurred through the woman, females were also associated with fertility and the cycle of life. By virtue of being child-bearers, they were the only ones deemed strong enough to contain great spirits and secret knowledge in their bodies. The caryatid stool symbolised this belief. Upon the king’s death, his royal stool became a receptacle of his spirit, which only a female spirit medium, a Mwadi, had the strength to incarnate. As the living incarnation of the deceased ruler, a Mwadi inherited the king’s royal titles, emblems, and residence, receiving gifts regularly from the new king. Upon her death, she was succeeded by another Mwadi to ensure the continuance of the royal spirit.\nThe female figure in Luba culture stood for different aspects of women simultaneously: their supporting role in society, ancestral continuity through the female line, important women in government, and their sacred association with the spiritual. Female figures also portrayed idealised physical perfection, expressed in very detailed scarification patterns and coiffures on the sculpted figures. It was not unheard of for Luba women to travel all the way to the capital to view a caryatid’s keloids or hairstyle to learn what was in vogue. Beauty was profoundly important to the Luba, who believed that beautiful coiffure and scarification indicated a civilised, elegant individual and provided a measure of the person’s worth. In most African cultures, beauty and goodness were equivalent. Not only was it a sign of beauty, but elaborate scarification was also an indication of a woman’s strength to bear children. Scarification and coiffures were also forms of identification, signalling to others the person’s profession, rank, and personal history. Patterns and coiffures were meticulously reproduced in otherwise generic ancestral statues to indicate their identity. Patterns could be combined in myriad ways to create different meanings, and were added throughout a person’s lifetime to reflect their new experience and identity.\nPunu masks, also known as okuyi dance masks, combined idealised feminine beauty and female association with spirits. Like other masking traditions in Gabon, such as the Kwele and Fang, okuyi masks were painted with kaolin, which was associated with healing, the spiritual, and the dead. The white base and appearance were long thought to be related to Japanese Noh theatre, but the style was indigenous to the Punu and its surrounding neighbours. Yet unlike other Gabon masks, the okuyi were less abstracted and tended towards greater naturalism. Punu carvers based them on the most beautiful woman in the community. The okuyi represents the spirit of a beautiful girl, indicated by the red lozenge scarification on her forehead, returning from the dead to the living world in times of mourning. Although a female mask, it was worn by a male performer in full body costume, who executed astonishing acrobatic moves on stilts in a dance known as mukudj. Once restricted to initiates, the okuyi dance is presently performed in public as a reassertion of the community’s cultural identity. By combining the symbolism of white kaolin and feminine beauty, the woman is intricately linked to the spiritual world.\nMask, Punu, Gabon, 19th to 20th century, Collection of musée du quai Branly, Gift of Mme Bluyssen © musée du quai Branly\nPicasso and African Art\nSince the Portuguese arrived in central Africa in the 1500s, travellers have brought African objects to Europe. Collecting increased significantly with the colonisation of the Congo region in the mid-19th century. One of the first displays of African objects took place in Paris in 1887 when some Kota objects from Gabon were exhibited.\nThe art of Africa was startling to European eyes, especially in the way certain features of the human form were abstracted and exaggerated. In the early 20th century, Henri Matisse, André Derain, Amedeo Modigliani and Pablo Picasso were inspired by African sculpture to move beyond traditional ideas of realism. Matisse was so intrigued that he used them as his inspiration for a portrait of his wife. African objects – with their refined form, gentle concave faces and abstract yet expressive features – attracted the admiration of Western art scholars and collectors. The concave surface was distinct from the prevalence of convex surfaces in Western art, appearing only with Cubism.\nYet despite genuine admiration of stylisation in African art, Western understanding was limited to the visual and emotional. Artworks were analysed without regard for the original culture that produced them, much less the cosmological context that imbued African art with spiritual and symbolic meaning. Paul Guillaume (1891- 1934), a French art dealer wrote that learning the meaning of African art may ”obscure one’s vision of the objects as sculpture”.\nPicasso’s first encounter with African sculpture may have been when his friend Matisse showed him a Kongo figure in 1906. The next year, Picasso saw African art at the ethnographic museum in the Palais du Trocadéro, Paris. He claimed that this encounter led him to understand what it meant to be an artist. Beginning in 1907, Picasso collected African masks and sculptures, with a taste for startling pieces and objects showing both human and animal characteristics. Picasso initially refused to acknowledge the role of African art on his works, candidly declaring, “African art? Never heard of it!” Only in his later years did he finally agree that they had a great influence.\nPicasso was profoundly inspired by his encounter with African art and its influence is evident throughout most of his artworks in his career. It was one of several factors that shattered the inherited concept that art should imitate nature. Instead, Picasso realised that artists should instead interpret what they see, think and feel. He once said, “Who sees the human face correctly: the photographer, the mirror, or the painter?” The painting, Dimanche (Sunday) is almost unrecognisable as a human portrait. The artist deconstructed and abstracted certain forms – that is, emphasised certain shapes and qualities – inviting the viewer to reflect on the artist’s emotions and imagination. In the exhibition, there are four artworks from the musée national Picasso, Paris that reflect strong influences from African sculpture, ranging from the early years (often referred to as Picasso’s African period, i.e. 1907-1909) right up to 1971, two years before his death.\nConclusion\nRecent studies of African art have frequently taken the approach of conducting stylistic analysis according to cultural groups. However, present studies take pains to avoid stringently limiting particular groups with certain styles, and for good reason – not only formal styles, but underlying beliefs are demonstrably shared by various peoples and cannot be limited by group boundaries. Transmitted via trade, travel and warfare, cultures have been absorbed, assimilated and adapted to fit into each community’s particular preferences.\nSocieties differ in their respective details, whether they were ruled by kings or clans, or in the precise adornment of their statuary. Yet unifying themes abound in stylistic formalities, the shared principle of ancestor veneration, the indistinct borders between the sacred and profane worlds, the special place of women in African society, and the importance of masquerades and ceremonies in uniting a community. A survey of African art across as broad a spectrum as central Africa would no doubt reveal innumerable differences and unique aspects, but threads remain that tie them together over centuries of eventful history and change.\nNotes", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/congo-river-arts-of-central-africa/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/congo-river-arts-of-central-africa/congo-river-arts-of-central-africa-1.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:58"},

Museum\nIndian Heritage Centre\nExhibition date\n23 November 2019 – 30 September 2020\nLocation\nSpecial Exhibition Gallery\nThis year marks 200 years of the Tamils in Singapore. However, Tamil connections with Singapore can be traced as far back as the 11th–13th centuries CE based on recent interpretations of the Singapore Stone. From the Coromandel Coast to the Straits: Revisiting Our Tamil Heritage presents a compendium of narratives that recount the experiences of Tamil diasporas in Southeast Asia and Singapore from pre-modern to contemporary times.\nAmong the South Asian languages, Tamil is perhaps the only example of a very ancient language that still survives as the mother tongue of millions of speakers in south India, Sri Lanka, and of diasporas in many parts of the world. Singapore’s Tamil community is distinct as they have adapted and integrated with local cultures. Primarily born out of the colonial enterprise, the Tamil community is today a vibrant part of Singapore’s multi-ethnic fabric.\nThis exhibition is presented in two parts: part one enumerates the odyssey of pre-modern Tamil diasporas in Southeast Asia while part two offers glimpses of lesser known 19th century pioneers and some of the oldest Tamil families in Singapore. Bringing together collections from around the world and treasured possessions from the community, this exhibition seeks to present an uninterrupted history of Tamils in Singapore. It also includes digital showcases featuring holograms of artefacts in the collections of other museums and institutions.\nDownload Brochure\n下载手册\nMuat turun risalah\nசிற்றேடு பதிவிறக்கம்\nCholamandalam to Coromandel\nCoromandel was a region known around the world for its trade textiles and goods from ancient times. The term “Coromandel” is the European derivative of Cholamandalam (“the realm of the Cholas” or “the land successfully conquered by the Cholas”). Also known as Chola Nadu or “land of the Cholas”, Coromandel referred to territories under the Chola dynasty in south-eastern India which included parts of present day Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.\nThe earliest reference to Cholamandalam can be found in an inscription located at the Brihadishvara Temple in Thanjavur dating to the 12th century CE. The oldest European mention of Coromandel appears in Roteiro de Vasco da Gama (Journal of the First Voyage of Vasco Da Gama) as Chomandarla. As a toponym, Coromandel first appears in Portuguese maps at the start of the 16th century.\nThe Coromandel coastline was a significant trading region in the Indian Subcontinent. It was home to a network of ports such as Pazhaverkadu, Nagapattinam, Parangipettai, Arumugam etc. which were unified by their participation in the Indian Ocean trade. By the 17th century, established mercantile communities were concentrated around ports along the Coromandel Coast.\nFor instance, in Southeast Asia Tamil Muslim trading communities from the Coromandel Coast such as Lebbai, Rawther, Marakayyar and Kayalar achieved fame as the Chulia merchants. These traders were engaged in commerce primarily with Ceylon (Sri Lanka), the Melaka Straits and other parts of Southeast Asia, although this trade gradually declined by the 19th century.\nEngraved Map showing the Coromandel Coast in relation to Southeast Asia by Galvao Antonio\n1557, Published in 1707 | Courtesy of National Library of Singapore\n \nPART 1 TAMILS IN PRE-MODERN SOUTHEAST ASIA\nAncient Connections\nMaritime links between South India and Southeast Asia date back to the late prehistoric period. During this period, Tamils acted as intermediaries in a trade network comprising the Roman Empire and the Mediterranean in the west to the other side of the Bay of Bengal. By the early centuries of the Common Era, pre-modern Tamil diasporas comprising seafarers and traders travelling to ports in Southeast Asian polities, had become common.\nThe early presence of Tamils in Southeast Asia is supported by epigraphic and archaeological finds that include medieval Tamil inscriptions, coins, pottery, ceramics, beads and bronze artefacts. The oldest inscription in the Tamil language dates to the 2nd or 3rd century CE on a potsherd found at Phu Khao Thong in south Thailand bearing the word turavon, meaning “ascetic”.\nA 3rd century CE touchstone inscription of a perumpattan (Tamil goldsmith) from Khuan Luk Pat in Krabi Province points to the presence of pre-modern professional diasporas. The Takua Pa inscription indicates that a manigramattar (Tamil mercantile guild) operated in Thailand in the 8th–9th centuries CE. The Lobu Tua inscription also mentions the Ayyavole trade guild who established a permanent outpost on the west coast of Sumatra.\nIn addition, the Sangam anthologies contain the earliest literary references to Tamil contact with Southeast Asia. The poem Pattinappalai, dating to the 2nd century CE, describes the import of foreign merchandise from Kedah to the Chola port of Poompuhar, while Chithalai Satthanar’s Manimekalai written in the 5th–6th centuries CE makes reference to Java.\nJeevaka Cintamani\nby Tirutakkatevar with commentary by Dr UV Swaminatha Iyer\nPublished in 1931\nOn loan from Sri Thendayuthapani Temple Library\n  Jeevaka Cintamani is a Jain Tamil poem which is considered one of the five great Tamil epics of the Sangam period. It was composed under Chola patronage and points to religious diversity in ancient Tamil country. The poem tells the story of Jeevaka, who through his merit becomes a king, yet renounces his station to attain spiritual salvation.\nEmpires and Faith\nThe earliest reference to Tamil religious beliefs can be found in Sangam literature. Each of the Sangam thinai (poetic landscape) was represented by a specific deity: Kurinji or hilly regions by Seyon or Murugan; Mullai or pastoral lands by Mayon or Vishnu; Marudam or agricultural areas by Senon or Indra; Neydal or coastal zones by Kadalon; and Palai or arid regions by Korravai.\nJainism and Buddhism also co-existed with Hindu practices during this period. For instance, Kanchipuram, Puhar or Kaveripumpattinam, and Madurai were known as the three ancient Tamil centres of Buddhism. Even the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang visited the court of Narasimha Pallava in the 7th century CE and noted that there were 100 Buddhist monasteries and over 10,000 monks.\nFrom the 7th century CE onwards, a devotional movement revived the Hindu sects of Siva and Vishnu as well as the worship of the mother goddess or Shakti. The classical form of Tamil temple architecture evolved after this period with the rise of the Pallava, Cholas, and Pandiya dynasties. Echoes of these art and architectural styles can be seen across Southeast Asia as remnants of its Hindu-Buddhist past.\nTamil folk versions of the Ramayana and Mahabharata also grew popular in Southeast Asia. For instance, the Ramakien’s inclusion of Mayil Ravanan, a character unique to Kambar’s Ramavataram, points to the Tamil influences in the narrative.\nMiniature Shrine Roof\nKedah, Malaysia, 7th century CE\nBronze\nOn loan from Asian Civilisations Museum\n  This miniature shrine roof was unearthed at an archaeological site at Bujang Valley, a Srivijayan trading port which reached its peak in the 7th through 9th centuries CE. Scholars have suggested that the roof bears close resemblance to a Pallava period monument constructed in the 7th century CE, known as Bhima Ratha at Mahabalipuram, an ancient Tamil port. The Pallava influence is also evident in early Hindu-Buddhist art and architecture at the Angkor Wat and Asram Maharosei complexes in Cambodia, and at the Dieng Plateau temples in Central Java.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoromandel Trade\nMercantile activity between the Tamil country and Southeast Asia was well in place long before the arrival of European companies in the region. For instance, Sultan Mansur Shah of Melaka (1459–1477 CE) sent emissaries to the Vijayanagara Empire in the 15th century to strengthen commercial ties, and the ships of the Sultan of Melaka sailed to Pazhaverkadu or Pulicat regularly.\nTamil traders such as the Marakkayars, the Mudaliars, and the Chettis were held in high esteem in the courts of Southeast Asian kingdoms and were made shahbandar (harbour master), bendahara (official) and saudagar raja (king’s merchant). They hailed from port towns such as Pazhaverkadu, Mylapore, Kunimedu, Cuddalore, Parangi Pettai, Nagore and Nagapattinam, and exported rice and textiles from the Coromandel in exchange for gold, copper and tin; spices such as nutmegs and cloves; and Chinese raw silk.\nNayinar Chetti, a native of Pazhaverkadu, was a leading textile trader in 16th century Melaka and appointed shahbandar by the Portuguese. Tome Pires in Suma Oriental mentions Nayinar Surya Deva, a well-known merchant who was engaged in trade from Melaka to the Moluccas. The Sultan of Banten appointed a Chetti merchant from Mylapore as laksamana (supreme commander of the navy). In the early 17th century, the Sultan of Pasai appointed Nayinar Kuniyappan, a Hindu merchant from Kunimedu as shahbandar.\nHowever, the influence of these Tamil trading communities declined by the 19th century.\nArikamedu\nThe Coromandel Coast included ports located across present day Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Arikamedu was one of the most important ports in this network, and had connections with Southeast Asian centres such as Khao Sham Kaeo in Thailand and Sembiran in Indonesia. Rouletted pottery and beads made in and/or by communities from Arikamedu recovered from these sites serve as evidence of these early connections.\nThe Periplus of the Erythrean Sea, in the early centuries of the Common Era, mentions Arikamedu as the port for Colondiphonda (an unknown type of ship) bound for Southeast Asia (Cheryse). Arikamedu was a significant production centre with strategic access to the Indian Ocean trade network.\nPiring (Dish)\nRomano-Indian Rouletted Ware\n2nd–3rd centuries\nMade in Arikamedu and found in Buni Site, Krowang, Northwest Java\nOn loan from National Museum of Indonesia\n  This piring (dish), made on a wheel, originated in Arikamedu. It possesses Romano-Indian Rouletted traits such as a brownish exterior with a grey interior; a smooth surface; and a flat interior decorated with concentric bands of rouletted patterns. These dishes were typically used to hold food and/or burial provisions. The presence of such Romano-Indian rouletted grey ware provides evidence of trade between India and Java during the first two centuries CE.\nKedah\nKedah was an important trade centre and ancient kingdom in the Malay Peninsula. Early south Indian navigators often relied on latitudinal readings, and their ships would sail in a straight line from southern India or Sri Lanka across the Bay of Bengal and make landfall at the Isthmus of Kra or at Kedah. Known in Chinese sources as Jiecha and as Kadaram in Tamil country, it was an ideal midway point for traders and pilgrims awaiting favourable monsoon winds to take them to their ultimate destinations in India and beyond or China.\nThe earliest references to Kedah can be found in Sangam literature composed in the second half of the 2nd century CE. Called Kazhagam in Pattinapalai, this term is derived from the Tamil word kazhk meaning iron or black rock. This type of iron was typically used to forge steel weapons which were then exported out of iron factories. Archaeological excavations in Kedah have led to the discovery of iron factories at the Sungai Batu dating back to the 3rd–6th centuries BCE.\nTuyere (Tube)\n3rd–6th centuries CE, excavated at Sungei Batu, Kedah\nBurnt clay\nOn loan from Centre for Global Archaeological Research Universiti Sains Malaysia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Singapore Connection\nArchaeological finds since the 1980s in the riverfront area strongly suggest that maritime networks connected India to the kingdom of Singapura, a prosperous regional port for much of the 14th century CE. Situated at the access points of both the Straits of Malacca and the South China Sea, this port was of strategic significance and was central in the lucrative India-China trade.\nSang Nila Utama, of the Srivijayan dynasty, founded the kingdom of Singapura in the late 13th century CE. He and his descendants ruled Singapore for five generations until Iskander Shah fled, driven out by Majapahit forces. He later founded the kingdom of Melaka. As attested in the Sejarah Melayu or Malay Annals, these kings of Singapura claimed descent from Raja Chulan of the Chola dynasty.\nThe victories of Chola kings in the Malay Archipelago are listed in inscriptions of the era. Thirteen place names are provided, of which four are unidentified till date. Some scholars have recognised one of these names, Valaippanduru, as Singapore, as Pancur was the placename for Fort Canning Hill at the heart of Old Singapura.\nThe name Singapura itself has Indic roots and it was likely adopted due to connections with South Indian polities. For instance, Singapuram was a common placename issued in the Chola territory while Singai Nagar was the capital of the Arya Chakravartis of Jaffna. Singapura was also the name of places in Tra Kieu, Vietnam as early as the 4th century CE.    \nSingapore Stone\n11th–13th centuries CE\nThe only extant part is in the collection of National Museum of Singapore.\nHologram recreated by IHC based on facsimile of the inscription provided by Asiatic Society of Bengal.\n  Tamil connections with Singapore can be traced to the 11th–13th centuries CE based on evidence presented in the form of the Singapore Stone. Formerly located at the mouth of the Singapore River, the inscription on the stone attracted curious visitors before the British dynamited it in 1843. When dynamited, the inscription split into several pieces. Three of the largest pieces were recovered by Lt Col James Low of the East India Company and sent to the Asiatic Society of Bengal.\nThe sandstone was about 3m high and 3m wide in size with 50 lines of an inscription. H Kern in 1908 identified that the inscription was written in Kawi, a Southeast Asian script derived from Southern Indian Brahmi. While he identified some Sanskrit sounding phrases, no interpretations on the inscription’s content was offered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOdyssey of Tamils - From the Coromandel Coast to the Straits\nOdyssey of Tamils, a specially commissioned documentary film, dwells on the pre-modern connections between Tamil regions, Southeast Asian polities and Singapore. Utilising evidence of Tamil connections in archaeological sites, museums and other institutions, this film presents the rich legacy of Tamil heritage in the region during pre-modern times. It also shows Singapore’s contemporary Tamils visiting sites of historical importance, and reminds us that our heritage is all around us, waiting to be re-discovered.\nThis film uses authoritative accounts presented by historians Iain Sinclair and Sureshkumar Muthukumaran on the role of Tamil diasporas in Southeast Asia and Singapore. From surveying early literary references to a toponymic review of cross-cultural interactions, the film features aspects of interactions between south Indian and Southeast Asian societies from ancient times.\nIt also investigates traces of the Cholas in Singapore through Dr Iain Sinclair’s survey of 14th century archaeological finds and the Singapore Stone in conjunction with narratives presented in Sejarah Melayu. Using a combination of re-enactments, interviews and contextual imagery, this film presents the odyssey of early Tamil diasporas in Southeast Asia and Singapore.\nPART 2 TAMILS IN 19TH CENTURY SINGAPORE\nMerchants: Naraina Pillai and his Contemporaries\nThe early Indian mercantile community in Singapore was diverse in ethnicity and religious affiliation and Tamils were influential merchants, traders, shopkeepers and small vendors. The Chulias were among the earliest Indians to settle permanently in Singapore, and by the 19th century, they had become one of the most influential sections of the Tamil community as leading operators of lighter and harbour boats, as well as shopkeepers and labourers. As early as 1827, Tamil Muslim migrants, led by Anser Saib, were given land for the construction of a mosque along South Bridge Road while Mohammed and Haja Mohideen constructed the shrine Nagore Dargah between 1828 and 1830.\nBetween 1823 and 1826, Sir Stamford Raffles introduced regulations to select and appoint headmen based on their respective community’s customs and social practices to deal with disputes. In 1822, William Farquhar, the Resident of Singapore nominated Sangra Chitty, a Hindu native of Malacca, as the overall headmen for the Indian community and Naraina Pillai, and Mayapoory or Viapoory, as the headmen for Coromandel Coast natives. In addition, Mahomet Lebbai, Fakir Tyndall and Ibrahimutto were nominated as headmen for labour while Mahomud Hussein, Ismail Lebbai and Sheikh Mahomet were nominated to represent the Tamil Muslim community.\nPetition submitted by Naraina Pillai\nOctober 1822, Singapore\nPaper\nOn loan from National Archives of Singapore\n  Naraina Pillai, a native of the Coromandel Coast, arrived in Singapore from Penang in May 1819, and is the earliest Tamil arrival recorded. He started out as a clerk in the colonial treasury but soon ventured into business, setting up a kiln producing bricks. He also set up a shop at the market place at Cross Street selling cotton goods.\nPillai played a crucial role in the establishment of Sri Mariamman Temple by providing the funds for the purchase of the temple site and installing the main deity when the temporary structure was completed in 1827. Pillai’s signature can be found in two petitions addressed to Sir Stamford Raffles. In this petition, Pillai sought Raffles’ permission to erect a shop in the location of his store that burnt down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScribes, Poets and Publishers: Munshi Abdullah, Makhdoom Saibu, and Others\n19th century literature attests to the diversity of early Indian residents in the Straits region. Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir, better known as Munshi Abdullah, arrived in Singapore from Malacca in mid-1819, and served as a scribe and interpreter for Sir Stamford Raffles. The first historical accounts on Indians in the Straits Settlements were available in the 1920s and 1930s following the publication of Saravana Muthuthamby Pillai’s Malaya Manmium on Tamils in Malaya, PNM Muthupalaniappa Chettiar’s Happy Malaya and RB Krishnan’s Indians in Malaya.\nTamil literature in Singapore, however, pre-dates the abovementioned publications and can be traced to the late 19th century. Examples include Munajathu Thirattu by Muhammad Abdul Kadir Pulavar, a compilation of Islamic religious poetry, which was published as early as 1872, and Singai Nagar Anthadi by Yazhpanam Sadasiva Pandithar in 1887. By the second half of the 19th century, Tamil Muslims and the Jawi Peranakans established the earliest vernacular presses in Singapore. These newspapers were published in Tamil and provided commentaries on subcontinental politics, social reform and local issues.\nIn 1873, CK Makhdoom Sahib established Denodaya Press which published Singai Varthamani, Singapore’s first Tamil newspaper in 1875. In 1876, the Jawi Peranakan company published Tankai Nesan, and in 1887, the Denodaya Press published Singai Nesan. In 1907, NR Partha founded and edited The Orient newspaper, and its Anglo-Tamil version Vijayan with a view to better understand the island’s residents. Other notable Tamil newspapers published during the early 20th century included Tamil Murasu by the Tamils Reform Association and edited by G Sarangapany.\nCopy of Singai Nesan founded by Makhdum Sahib and Muhammad Abdul Kadir\n27 June 1887, Singapore\nPaper (Reproduction)\nCourtesy of National Library Board, Singapore\n\nBankers and Patrons: The Story of the Rm VLN Chettiar Family\nNattukottai Chettiars are one of the oldest Tamil communities in Singapore and they settled in Singapore during the 1820s. As a community of private financiers and merchant bankers, the Chettiars were the main source of private financing through medium and long-term credit, and their clientele was cosmopolitan. They were also keen advocates of education and established the Chettiar’s Premier Institution. In addition, the Chettiars built Sri Thendayuthapani Temple on Tank Road in April 1859, and the popular festival-procession of Thaipusam dedicated to Murugan was first celebrated at the temple in 1860.\nThe family of Rm VLN (Ramanathan Vellayappan Lakshmanan Nachiappan) Subbiah Chettiar has its roots in Kallal in Chettinad. Rm V Subramaniam Chettiar arrived in Singapore in 1892. He was a private financier and with his brother Lakshmanan Chettiar, co-founded his firm located at 56 Market Street. Lakshmanan adopted Subramaniam Chettiar’s son Nachiappan who continued in the financing business, and his son Rm VLN Subbiah Chettiar was the last of the private financiers in this family.  The practice of retaining the initials of several generations in their name is unique to the Chettiar community and provides a clue to a Chettiar’s genealogy.\nThis is one of Singapore’s oldest Nattukottai Chettiar families with a long history in Singapore dating back to the 19th century.\nKazhuthiru or wedding necklace\nMid-20th century, Chettinad\nGold\nOn loan from Rm VLN Subbiah Chettiar Family\n  This large-sized thali (marriage necklace) is used exclusively by the Nagarathar Chettiar community of Tamil Nadu. It typically comprises 35 pieces and is strung together by 21 lengths of twisted strings smeared with turmeric. The central pendant (ethanam), has four sharp spikes representing the four vedam (knowledge).\nIncorporated in the pendant is an image of Subrahmanya standing with his parents, Shiva and Parvati, who are seated on a nandi (bull). In weddings, the groom would tie this necklace around the bride's neck after the exchange of vows. The kazhuththu uru is a ceremonial thali that is worn during weddings and on special occasions such as for the celebration of the husband's 60th birthday.\n\n\n\nA Fleet of Carriages: The Story of Sangoo Thevar and Descendants\nIn the early 19th century, Singapore’s land transport system was comprised mainly bullock carts, horse carriages, jin-rickshaws and bicycles. Sangoo Thevar, Palaniappa Chetty, Sundra Daven, Meydin, Ismail Shah and Syed Ibrahim were some of the Tamil horse carriage contractors. Sangoo Thevar (Sangoo is Tamil for conch) arrived in Singapore in the 1850s with his wife from Mannargudi, Thanjavur. He acquired a fleet of horse carriages and leased them out.\nIn the succeeding decades, he amassed a fortune from this business and became a prominent member of the Indian community in Singapore. Sangoo Thevar had six children, Shanmugam Pillai, Parvathi, Regunath, Rajagopal, Lakshmi, and Meenachi Sundram. When Sangoo Thevar passed away in 1890, Shanmugam, the eldest, remained in Singapore and sent his siblings and mother back to India in 1895. Shanmugam subsequently became the Chief Clerk of Singapore Telegraph Office in 1912. Sangoo Thevar’s youngest son, Meenachi Sundram, returned to Singapore in 1912 with his mother and later became the first Asian Headmaster of Anglo-Chinese School in Singapore.\nSangoo Parvathi's daughter Anjalaiammal married Avadai Thevar, a construction contractor who arrived in Singapore in the early 20th century from Thanjavur, and their daughter, Avadai Dhanam, became the first lady of Singapore as the wife of the late CV Devan Nair, third President of the Republic of Singapore.\nPhotograph of Sangoo Thevar riding a gharry or horse carriage as identified by Pushpa Ramanujan\nLate 19th century, Singapore\nPaper (Reproduction)\nCourtesy of National Museum of Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Vaddukoddai to Singapore: Annamalai Pillai, JA Supramaniam and Descendants\nArumugam Annamalai Pillai was born in Vaddukoddai, Jaffna in 1839. He was educated at St John’s College in Yazhpanam or Jaffna and later graduated as a surveyor in India in 1868. He was appointed Government Surveyor at Galle where he met James Wheeler Woodford Birch. Birch later became the Colonial Secretary of Singapore and transferred Annamalai to Singapore to become its Government Surveyor.\nAnnamalai arrived in Singapore in 1875 and became Chief of the Survey department. Annamalai introduced the practice of valuing land in Singapore by the square foot as he anticipated the rise in land value as the port city developed. He resigned from colonial service in 1883 and established a leading private practice in partnership with Alfred William Lermit. It is estimated that Annamalai was responsible for surveying three quarters of the land in Singapore. According to title deeds and historical records, Annamalai owned estates in Katong and Siglap by 1885. He also started buying tracts of land in Tanglin and the Bukit Timah area, and these surroundings were collectively named after him as Namly Avenue. Annamalai Pillai was also a founding member of Singapore Ceylon Tamil Association.\nAnnamalai Pillai’s nephew, Rev JA Supramaniam, married Harriet Navamani Joseph, whose lineage traced back to 13th century Jaffna royalty. Their son Dr JMJ Supramaniam was a pioneer in the management and elimination of tuberculosis in Singapore, and his son, Paul Supramaniam, has recorded his family tree showing five generations of his family in Singapore, and tracing their lineage to Kulasekara Singai Aryan Pararajasekaran Arya Chakravarty, King of Jaffna (1246-56 CE). \nSet of 8 title deeds for properties owned by Annamalai Pillai at Tank Road, Confederate Coconut Plantation, Siglap, Bukit Timah Road and Tanglin\n1886–1913, Singapore\nPaper\nOn loan from Lt Col Dato Paul Supramaniam and Elfie Eleza Kamarudin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Mannargudi to Singapore: The Ramasamy Family\nP Ramasamy and his wife Rengammal arrived in Singapore in 1886 from Thirumakottai in Mannargudi, Tamil Nadu. They belonged to a community known as the Agamudyar Thevars who were landowners. On their arrival, Ramasamy joined the Straits Settlements Police Force and soon rose to the rank of Sergeant. The couple had four children Vaithinathen, Angammal, Muthia, and Manikam. Angammal married her relative Kuppusamy, a cattle trader.\nKuppusamy and his younger sister Ponnammal jointly owned a thaan or shed with stables for cattle and horse carts at Rochor. The horse carts were primarily rented out for the use of guests at the nearby Raffles Hotel. Ponnammal was also an industrious female entrepreneur who ran a lucrative kootu or tontine business in Rochor. Lakshmi, the daughter of Angammal and Kuppusamy, was trained in classical music by her illustrious musician aunt Amballigay who had come to Singapore in 1933 as the fourteen-year old bride of Manikam. The first public performance by Amballigay’s musical troupe took place in May 1937 at Farrer Park when Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter Indra made a short visit to Singapore and Malaya.\nLakshmi later married Rengasamy, the son of Kuala Lumpur’s wealthy Tamil merchant RM Davar, and the brother of the Indian National Army veteran Janaki Athi Nahappan. Lakshmi Rengasamy Davar was an educator and philanthropist who made charitable contributions to several Hindu temples and the Ramakrishna Mission.\nThe Ramasamy family trace their lineage in Singapore to six generations.\nPortrait of P Ramasamy\nLate 19th century, Singapore\nPaper (Reproduction)\nCourtesy of Ananda Manikam\n\n\n\nThey came from Jaffna: The Family of Eliyathamby\nJaffna (Yazhpanam in Tamil) is located in northern Sri Lanka (Ceylon in the past). Tamils from this region included descendants of the old Tamil kingdom of Jaffna, the Vannimais or descendants of chieftains. Most of the early Tamils from Sri Lanka arrived as colonial personnel to Malaya and Singapore.\nBorn in Changanai, a market town in Jaffna, Eliyathamby worked as an assistant overseer for the British in Malaya. In this role, Eliyathamby supervised labour who cleared and built the roads that connected important towns. Eliyathamby’s grandfather Venasithamby and father, Muthuthamby had migrated from Jaffna to Malaya in the 1850s. They owned rice fields in Malaya and conducted trade with Jaffna. Eliyathamby subsequently married a relative Meenachi, from Chulipuram.\nBoth Meenachi and Eliyathamby belonged to a community known as Vellalar and hailed from a line of chieftains. Meenachi and Eliyathamby travelled to Malaya in the 1890s by a sailboat, and their descendants eventually settled in Singapore. Meenachi was a skilled  culinarian , and brought with her cooking implements such as grinding stones, a wooden mortar and pestle as well as heirloom brass vessels that were passed through the generations.\nVenasithamby and his descendants have been in Malaya and Singapore for seven generations.\nPortrait of V Eliyathamby\n1930s - early 1940s, Ipoh\nPaper\nOn loan from Indra Iswaran d/o ES Muthu and Lavan Iswaran\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTamil Women\nFamily accounts and oral historical sources have informed us that Tamil women have been in Singapore from the second half of the 19th century. As labour, as convicts, as wives, and as entrepreneurs Tamil women were diverse in the walks of life they occupied in Singapore. Alamayloo Pillay arrived from Mauritius with her father Sabapathy Pillai in the second half of the 19th century and in 1890, she married Koona Vayloo Pillay. Madam Ponnammal was a private financier with operations at Rochor in the late 19th century. These are but two names of Tamil women who were 19th century personas in Singapore. What of the others who remain anonymous? This section serves as a reminder of the stories of many Tamil women that remain obscure, waiting to be discovered.\nHeart in Hand – a marriage of identities | Anurendra Jegadeva | Hand painted on wood | 2019, Commissioned by Indian Heritage Centre\nThe story of the female Tamil migrant is often shrouded in anonymity and little is known of the lives of early Tamil female migrants to Singapore and Malaya. In response to this gender-imbalance, Anurendra Jegadeva attempts to recreate the journey of a contemporary diasporic Tamil girl by using his daughter as the central figure for this installation titled Heart in Hand.\nThe installation juxtaposes her Western oriented values against her ethno-cultural background inherited from her grandmother. The work further conveys the disconnect, even indifference felt by the children of migrants as they assimilate and negotiate their way through the same issues of identity and place, albeit twice removed, that was experienced by their grandparents. \nThe central panel of the altar presents Anurendra’s daughter, and she is surrounded by paraphernalia of the migrant including cooking implements, a famous migrant ship, auspicious birds, and ancestral portraits. The six wings of the altar, inspired by a thali, are hinged to the main panel. Embellished on back and front, each wing contains miniature paintings that contribute to the narrative of contradiction.\nThe middle boxes within these hinged wings house light-boxes with reproductions of Migrant Letters, works that incorporate letters from migrants. On the top of the panel, is a gopuram (temple tower-like crown) that houses another light-box depicting an electric guitar-playing Saraswati, the goddess of learning.\nDuality and Diversity: The Family of B Govindasamy Chettiar\nIn the 19th century, residents in the Madras Presidency were conversant in Tamil, regardless of their own linguistic backgrounds. Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam were spoken across the Presidency, and residents were receptive to these diverse influences in culture and tradition. Consequently, migrants who arrived from the Madras Presidency, while predominantly Tamil, included those who were well versed in both Tamil and their own cultural and linguistic practices.\nOne such example was B Govindasamy Chettiar who arrived in Singapore at the turn of the century. He was proprietor of the Indian Labour Company and supplied the harbour board with wharf and dockyard workers. B Govindasamy’s offices and the labour quarters were located along Keppel Road. He was well known for distributing free meals at his shed to port workers and to members of the community which earned him the moniker Kottai Govindasamy. After a short illness, he died on 6 April 1948 at the age of 59 and his funeral attracted attendees from all races. Throughout the 1940s, B Govindasamy Chettiar was involved in the management of Vadapathirakaliamman Temple, and after his death, his nephew SL Perumal oversaw major renovations and the temple’s expansion in the 1970s. \nPhotograph of the Indian Labour Company\n1935\nPaper, 34x40cm\nOn Loan from the family of B Govindasamy Chettiar and SL Perumal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJourney Across the Seas: The Adhynamilagi Family\nWhen looking at Tamil heritage in early Singapore, it is important to remember that a large Tamil mercantile community had long been present in Malacca, Penang, Myanmar, Medan, and Vietnam. The mobility of these traders, influenced the pattern of migration undertaken by Tamil diasporas. The descendants of Adhyakonar, an agriculturalist in the village of Mahibalanpatti in Sivagangai District, Tamil Nadu are one such example. Staunch followers of the patron guardian deity Adhynamilagi Ayyanar at Maruthangudi near Pillayarpatti. Narayanan father of Adhynamilagi and his uncle Mangaipahan both travelled via Nagapattinam to Southeast Asia.\nMangaipahan established himself as a successful textile trader at the turn of the century in Saigon and Hanoi and was a patron of the Sri Mariamman temple there. Adhynamilagi boarded a ship from Nagapattinam and sailed for Singapore, and then joined his uncle in Vietnam to help him in his textile business. He returned to Singapore in the mid-20th century and worked as a clerk with the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company. Adhynamilagi was English-educated and multilinguist, lived in Market Street. Later brought his son to Singapore with him, while his wife lived in India and visited occasionally. In his later years, by the 1970s, he became a guide for Japanese tourists visiting Singapore. The family of Adhynamilagi can trace their roots back to 4 generations in Southeast Asia.\nPhotograph of N Adhynamilagi taken in Hanoi at Bae HO/Bac Ho studio\n21 October 1949, Hanoi\nOn Loan from A Adhynarayanan, Menaka and family in memory of the late N Adhynamilagi and Mangayarkarasi\n\n\n\n\nPortraiture\nEuropean curiosity over Asian diversity is manifest in the emergence of portraiture and photography by the 19th century in Singapore. The commodification and exotification of Indian culture for western audiences was also achieved through the medium of photography. A Sachtler of Sachtler & Co and John Thomson of Thomson Bro shot some of the earliest portraits of Indians in Singapore between the 1860s and the 1870s. Later, the firm of GR Lambert & Co, which operated from 1877 until the end of the First World War, produced the single most important collection of images of Singapore in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nThese carefully curated photographs capture people from diverse trades and professions ranging from hawkers to labour; the exotic fashion of matriarchal women; and the family as a unit. Photographs such as these, together with those of other migrants, reinforced the exotic and mysterious image of Singapore. However, it is unfortunate that the names of these profiles were never documented, and they remain anonymous to date. To reverse the colonial neglect surrounding these studies are portraits of Tamil pioneers from the 19th and early 20th centuries identified in family collections and/or commissioned for this exhibition.\nKoona Vayloo Pillay\nIn 1837, Seetharama Pillay and his son-in-law Koona Kotaiya, natives of Erode, Tamil Nadu, arrived in Singapore. Koona Kotaiya was a stone mason, and he found employment in the construction industry. Eventually, he acquired land and started a successful dairy farm business at the 9th mile estate around Dairy Farm Road.\n  His son, Koona Vayloo Pillay started working for a European, ER Koek. Noting his honesty and hardwork, Koek financed and supported Koona Vayloo Pillay in building a dairy business. Starting from scratch, Koona Vayloo Pillay begun his own successful dairy farm business at the 9th mile estate, and later expanded into investing in properties. He was popularly known as “Malai Vayloo Pillay” in Tamil, as his house was atop a hill at Bideford Road. He built a mansion called “Cashmere House” in Sophia Road, and had properties in East Coast, Chinatown, Little India, Orchard Road, Tanjong Pagar, Siglap and Fernhill.\n  Pillay’s grave is the only Hindu grave to be preserved at the Bidadari Memorial Garden. Alamayloo Sabapathy Pillay, also known as Allamelu aachi, migrated from Mauritius to Singapore with her father Sabapathy Pillai in the second half of the 19th century. In 1890, she married Koona Vayloo Pillay.\nRevisiting the Past\nTamils in Singapore are a unique diaspora who have settled in the country, through continuous waves of migration, over a period of 200 years. It is evident that the roots of most present-day Tamil culture, customs, religious ideologies and affiliations in Singapore can be traced to the 19th century and that they have continued to evolve over the centuries. In fact, Tamil identity today is the product of a long history of traditional practices which have combined and incorporated local influences over time.\nAs early migrants became settlers, language and literature became useful tools that fostered social integration amongst the diverse groups of Tamils. Tamil language education was provided as early as 1834 in Singapore, and Anglo-Tamil schools were established in 1873 and 1876 to teach English through the use of Tamil. Today, Tamil is one of the four official languages of Singapore, and community and state-led efforts in the preservation and promotion of Tamil language continue unabated.\nThis exhibition traces the long history of Tamils in Singapore and highlights the stories of Tamil pioneers who played integral roles in the development of early Singapore. Since then, the Tamil community has continued to evolve, and the Singaporean Tamils of today are a vibrant and diverse community. They constitute an estimated 5% of Singapore’s population and yet continue to play an important role in shaping Singapore’s future.", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/From-the-Coromandel-Coast-to-the-Straits", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/from-the-coromandel-coast-to-the-straits/coromandel_sample_02b.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:59"},

Photo credit: Ministry of Information and the Arts (MITA) through National Archives Singapore .\nThe vision of Singapore as a Garden City was first conceptualised by the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew in May 1967 that kickstarted the greening movement of Singapore in the 1970s. Many considered Mr Lee to be Singapore’s chief gardener who was inspired by the tree-lined boulevards that he had come across overseas. An intensive tree-planting programme was launched by the Parks and Trees Division that saw more than 55,000 new trees planted across the island by the end of 1970. Many of the trees planted during the period are still standing tall today.\nIn 1976, the Parks and Recreation Department was set up to replace the Parks and Trees Division. The National Parks Board was subsequently established in 1990 and expanded in 1996 to take the lead in managing, developing and enhancing Singapore’s parks, park connectors and roadside greenery. Today, Singapore is one of the greenest cities in the world. The lush urban greenery that we have is a result of sustained and dedicated efforts to green up Singapore over the past few decades. As we transform into a City in Nature, we will further restore nature into the urban environment and bring people closer to nature. \nAn important pillar of the City in Nature vision, the OneMillionTrees movement aims to plant one million more trees across Singapore by 2030. Trees help to provide shade and reduce the urban heat island effect, providing a much-needed respite for city dwellers. They are also important carbon dioxide and are part of the solution to mitigate the effects of climate change. For urban fauna, trees increase the ecological connectivity between fragmented habitats, allowing animals to move from one green space to the other. \nThis photo-essay will bring you through the Civic District to explore some of the majestic trees that have witnessed our city’s progress over the years.\nA map depicting the locations of the iconic trees mentioned in this photo-essay. \nRain Trees (Samanea saman)\nLocation: Istana main gate\nLofty Rain Trees outside the Istana greet visitors from all walks of life. \nThe journey begins at the grand main gate of the Istana where a row of lofty Rain Trees graces the entrance. Planted in the 1970s at the request of the late Prime Minister Lee, these Rain Trees had the honour of welcoming the different Presidents of Singapore and greeting visitors to the Istana, from foreign delegates to members of the public. Rain Trees are generally fast-growing and can reach up to 25 m in height. Their umbrella-shaped crowns provide pleasant shade to passers-by along Edinburgh Road and serve as a green lung of the Orchard area.\nOriginally from tropical America, Rain Trees were first reportedly introduced into Singapore in 1876 and planted extensively along major roads, expressways and parks for their shade-providing benefits. In the evenings or before rainy weather, their small leaflets will fold up to direct the rain water straight into the soil. It is also this characteristic that gives this species the common names “Rain Tree” and “Pukul Lima” (which means 5 o’clock in Malay).\nAngsana Trees (Pterocarpus indicus)\nLocation: School of the Arts\n“The Seed” art sculpture now stands at where the original tree once was, welcoming students into the school’s compound. \nOn the steps of the School of the Arts (SOTA) once stood an iconic Angsana tree known as the SOTA tree or the Tree of Knowledge. The tree was preserved during the development and building of the school and was incorporated into the design of the steps leading up to the building. Although the tree stood tall for almost 40 years, it ultimately could not stand the test of time and succumbed to structural defects. Two days before the removal of the tree, the school held a small farewell ceremony for the tree where students put up a lively performance and recounted their memories of the tree.\nThe legacy of the tree continues to live on in “The Seed”, an art piece inspired by the seeds of the Angsana tree. The artwork is installed on the exact location where the tree used to stand and continues to welcome the students and visitors to the SOTA campus.\nBodhi Trees (Ficus religiosa)\nLocation: Singapore Management University Campus Green\nThe Bodhi Tree was transplanted into SMU’s Campus Green and is a popular rest spot for students during their lunch breaks. \nA venerable Bodhi Tree resides in the quiet compound of the SMU Campus Green. The tree is believed to be over a hundred years old and started life as a seed planted by a prisoner of the old Bras Basah convict jail. It was uprooted in 2005 when SMU started construction of its campus on the old site of the former prison complex and replanted and integrated into the current SMU Campus Green landscape.\nThe Bodhi Tree is a medium fig tree that is native to the Indian subcontinent and part of China. It has naturalised in Singapore and can be found growing spontaneously. The leaves have a distinctive tail-like tip and are spirally arranged on the branches. This tree is worshipped by the Hindus and Buddhists and is usually planted around temples. It is believed that the Buddha sat under this species of tree when he achieved realisation.\nTravellers Palm Trees (Ravenala madagascariensis)\nLocation: Raffles Hotel\nThe Traveller’s Palm tree is an iconic feature of Bras Basah Road leading up to the entrance of the Raffles Hotel. \nThe entrance of the Raffles Hotel and Bras Basah Road is dotted with towering Traveller’s Palm trees, which also inspired the symbol of the Raffles Hotel. Its leaves grow in an East-West orientation and served as a natural compass for travellers in the past. They were also useful as rainwater collects at the base of the leaves, providing much-needed thirst relief.\nThe name “Traveller’s Palm” is a misnomer as the plant is not a true palm. While its growth form has a palm-like appearance, it is actually a closer relative of the Bird of Paradise ( Strelitzia reginae ) and the Banana plant ( Musa sp.). The paddle-shaped leaves fan out evenly in a welcoming gesture to passers-by. Similarly, as Singapore slowly eases the COVID-19 safe management measures, we hope to once again welcome visitors back to our City in Nature.\nBelinjau Trees (Gnetum gnemon)\nLocation: Civilian War Memorial\nThe Belinjau trees standing at attention, almost as if saluting the lost civilian lives in World War II. \nThe Civilian War Memorial, located in War Memorial Park, is a national monument that commemorates the lives of the civilian victims of World War II. The footpath leading up to the monument is lined with Belinjau trees on both sides. Native to Southeast Asia and Western Pacific Ocean islands, the Belinjau tree can grow up to 20 m tall and the kernels of the seeds can be made into delicious belinjau crackers. \nThe Belinjau trees were specifically chosen to plant in the park due to their conical shape that bear resemblance to the War Memorial. Their straight and upright form looks almost as if they are standing at attention and saluting the civilians who lost their lives in the war. Similarly, the landscape around the park complements the monument and evokes feelings of solemnity.\nGreen tunnel lined with Rain Trees (Samanea saman)\nLocation: Along Connaught Drive\nConnaught Drive is lined with Rain Trees on both sides, some of which are NParks Heritage Trees.\nAnother famous sight of Rain Trees lies before the entrance of Esplanade Park. The two rows of Rain Trees were thought to have been planted since the late 1880s, during the time when tree planting was formalised by the then Superintendent of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, Nathaniel Cantley. Some of the key events witnessed by these trees include Singapore’s declaration of de facto independence from British colonial rule in 1963 and the first National Day celebrations held at the Padang in 1966.\nPresently, the Rain Trees’ lush canopy provides a picturesque framing of the stately colonial buildings on the opposite side of the Padang and creates a cooling ‘green tunnel’ that runs through the heart of the city. In 2016, 22 of the Rain Trees were endorsed as Heritage Trees, forming the “Avenue of Heritage Trees”. Find out more about Heritage Trees here .\nCannon Ball Trees (Couroupita guianensis)\nLocation: Esplanade Park\nThe flowers of the Cannon Ball Tree are unusual and spectacular, drawing visitors to see them up close in person.\nThe Cannon Ball Tree in Esplanade Park is an impressive sight to behold. With a girth circumference of almost 3 m and flower stalks branching out from its main trunk, one would be drawn closer to take a closer look at this unusual tree. As its name suggests, the Cannon Ball Tree produces large, round fruits on its massive trunk that bear similarity to cannon balls. This growth form of bearing fruits on the main trunk is known as cauliflory. The fruits take 18 months to develop and will remain on the trunk for a year or more before they eventually mature and fall off. The large, showy flowers are used by Hindus in Singapore for worship while in Sri Lanka, they are often used as offerings at Buddhist shrines and temples.\nAngsana Trees (Pterocarpus indicus)\nLocation: Esplanade Park\nThe five Angsana trees were transplanted into Esplanade Park to recreate the iconic “Gor Zhang Chiu Kar”.\nBesides the Rain Trees and the Cannon Ball Tree, Esplanade Park is also home to the famous five Angsana trees near the Lim Bo Seng Memorial. This site was a popular dating spot between the 1960s and 1980s and is affectionately known as “Gor Zhang Chiu Kar” in Hokkien, which translates literally to “under the shade of five trees”. It was often a stopover for those who were heading to the Satay Club, a food centre nearby at that time.\nAngsana trees are large deciduous trees that were introduced to Singapore in the early 19th century and planted widely around the island due to their fast growth and dense, dome-shaped crowns that served as excellent shade providers. Unfortunately, the original five ‘Gor Zhang Chiu Kar” trees had to be removed in the 1990s due to a fungal disease outbreak and to prevent further spread of the disease. In 2015, NParks were able to recreate the nostalgic dating spot by transplanting five disease-resistant Angsana trees from Upper Serangoon Road. A piece of history is thus preserved at the very spot, inviting families and weekend picnickers to revisit fond memories. \nFor more information on the tree species mentioned in this essay, visit NParks Flora & Fauna Web here .\nJoin in on Singapore’s greening initiatives!\nIf you have enjoyed this photo-essay and would like to learn more about the trees in the Civic District, join them on their bi-monthly Civic District Tree Trail guided walk.

Text by Peter Lee and Naomi Wang\nMuseSG Volume 9 Issue 3 – Jan 2017\nPort Cities: Multicultural Emporiums of Asia, 1500-1900 was on display at the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) from November 4, 2016 to February 19, 2017. Peranakan scholar Peter Lee, together with ACM’s former director Dr. Alan Chong, conceptualised this show, the first of its kind to explore the histories of Asian port cities through the perspective of local inhabitants, rather than European colonial ties and trading networks.\nPort cities perfectly encapsulate a fundamental human process that has existed since time immemorial – the constant mixing of people, objects and ideas. These cities and the powerful cultural dynamics within and between them reflect how culture is formed, spread and shared. The story of port cities in Asia is the story of multiracial communities and networks. It is also the story of global trade, diverse consumption of objects and the spectrum of responses to them. Supply and demand engendered extensive competition, counterfeits, cheap replicas, as well as innovations and improvisations. New cultural forms emerged. Singapore – an active port in the mid-19th century, as depicted in the panoramic view painted by Percy Carpenter – is a large part of this story.\nPercy Carpenter, View of Singapore from Mount Wallich, 1856.\nCollection of National Museum of Singapore.\nOceans and waterways facilitated the movement of people, ideas and goods, while climate and trade winds governed them. By considering three categories of cultural dynamics in Asia – divergence, convergence and integration – and by connecting contact points and the complexity and confusion of multi-directional cultural flows, the exhibition managed to elicit new ways of thinking about history.\nIn the period leading up to the 17th century, starting up life and trading in a new country took place against enormous odds. Those who succeeded reaped rich rewards and made a tremendous impact on material culture. The production of copies and cheap imitations, and their wide circulation created international styles and fashions. The rare example of a kimono made of Indian chintz is testament to the international circulation of textiles and their adaptation in local contexts. Over time, this creativity and the ever-changing dynamics of port cities facilitated what we understand today as modernity and globalisation, and also the development of popular culture.\nInner robe with standing tree design, tailored in Japan during the Edo period, c.1603 to 1868. Aichi, Japan. Matsuzakaya Collection.\nNew Places, New Lives\nThe exhibition began with an eclectic array of mannequins depicting 19th century inhabitants of Singapore. The presence of people from different backgrounds, dressed in their own fashions, was common not only in Singapore, but also in the many port cities of Asia. Five intimate stories of transnational communities which illustrate the diversity of port cities were told through the objects on display.\nMobile and enterprising, Chettiars have been trading beyond their homeland of the Chettinad region, in Tamil Nadu, India, for centuries. More than 200 years ago, Chettiars built temples in Saigon. Links were strengthened when Pondicherry (near Chettinad) and Saigon became part of the French colonial empire. The treasuries of Chettiar temples in Saigon were filled with ornate gold jewellery offered to deities as devotional embellishments. A gold prabhavali would have been placed around the image of a deity.\nArch for an icon (prabhavali), 20th century. Vietnam.

This family portrait was made in Batavia, where she had gone after her father’s death. At the time, she was married to the wealthy Dutch merchant Pieter Cnoll. Upon Cnoll’s death, she became a very rich widow. Her marriage four years later to Johan Bitter and his subsequent attempts to take over her inheritance led to one of the most famous and acrimonious international court cases of the 17th century. It was fought all the way to The Hague, where she passed away.\nJacob Coeman. Pieter Cnoll, Cornelia van Nijenrode and their daughters, 1665.

Together with thirty other disciples, he followed his Zen master, Yinyuan Longqi (Ingen Ryu ̄ ki in Japanese), to the port city of Nagasaki, Japan, in 1654 to serve the Chinese population living there. Seven years later, Master Ingen established the O ̄ baku sect of Zen Buddhism, centred at Manpuku-ji in Uji, near Tokyo. Dokutan was part of this new sect and he later established a Zen temple, Shosan Horin-ji, in Hamamatsu. In addition to his Zen teachings, he also made paintings, three of which werepart of this exhibition. The practices of the O ̄ baku sect are closely linked with Pure Land Buddhism and Ming culture. Dokutan himself had a strong inclination towards Pure Land philosophy and also held strong Confucian attachments to his parents and ancestors.\nSushin. Inscribed by Dokutan.

He arrived in Java in 1670 to serve as a soldier in Batavia and other outposts. He studied the Malay language and kept an illustrated diary of his travels, making portraits of the various people in the region, as well as drawings of exotic flora and fauna. The diary also includes sketches of mermaids. When he returned to Europe, he worked for a Roman Catholic church in St Gallen, Switzerland. He left his diaries and other objects collected on his travels to that church before returning home in 1720.\nTravel diary of Georg Franz Miller, 1669 to 1682.

Born in Malacca, he had a strict Muslim upbringing and scholarly education. The book is written in Jawi, and gives vivid accounts of everyday life and politics in Singapore, Malacca and the region. For his literary contributions, Abdullah is often referred to as the “father of modern Malay literature\".\nHikayat Abdullah, 1849. Mission Press, Singapore.\nCollection of National Library Board.\nOwning, Collecting, and Commissioning\nThe convergence of people and goods in port cities was made visible by diverse architecture and imported international goods. The multicultural populations spurred conspicuous consumption, social competition and an increasingly globalised marketplace. Unified tastes and fashions became the norm. Members of various communities residing in a port city often coveted the same luxury objects and imported goods. The material culture of port cities was therefore dominated by the coexistence of a comprehensive array of imported goods from the whole of Asia.\nOne section of the exhibition was devoted to objects from Batavia, perhaps the most important port city in Asia in the 18th century. International goods circulated widely among its multiracial residents, who sported the latest fashions. The flood of Asian goods into this metropolis was probably unprecedented in history. Jan Daniël Beijnon’s painting of a Eurasian woman from Batavia shows an interior space filled with imported goods from Asia. The silk tablecloth and Chinese wooden folding screen (also referred to as a Coromandel screen, after the name of the Indian port from which these screens were exported) were common luxury goods of Asia.\nJan Daniël Beijnon.

Batavia.\nCollection of Mr Jan Veenendaal.\nMayhem: The Dark Side of Dynamic Encounters\nUnderlying the extraordinary convergences of people was the brutality of travel and urban life. Piracy was rife, mortality on voyages high and among warring nationalities, the plunder of cargo was justified as legal booty. Commerce was often conducted under mercenary and violent terms, and involved harming competitors, forcing agreements, then ignoring agreed-upon terms of such agreements. Trade and armed force went together hand in hand.\nSlavery and human trafficking had great impact on urban society, intensifying the racial diversity of the population. Political and religious leaders put into place extremely ruthless measures to control the population. Japan, for example, underwent a period of isolationism under the sakoku (literally “closed country”) policy from 1633 to 1866. Strict restrictions were put in place on the entry of foreigners and the movement of Japanese people abroad. An official 1808 document from the Hirado archives details foreigners who were detained by Japanese authorities due to their illegal entry into Japan. Regulations on the population, however, did not stop violent upheavals nor the whole range of human vices, including murder, gambling, prostitution and illicit drugs.\nScroll depicting detained foreigners, 1808. Japan.\nCollection of Matsura Historical Museum, Hirado.\nContriving, Combining, and Creating\nThe concentration of diversity in port cities engendered not only racially hybrid communities, but also a multiplicity of hybrid forms. Adaptations and improvisations were the norm because of the commercial nature of most aspects of cultural output. In environments where migrants far from their motherlands made up a large percentage of the population, the traditional was often transgressed. These modern elements can be traced through the material culture of port cities, in the heterogeneous forms and trends, and in the diversity of objects. A locally produced chair from 18th century Batavia features hybrid forms that are a mix of Dutch and Chinese designs. In addition, Chinese-style lacquer coating indicates that the chair was the work of Chinese craftsmen in Batavia.\nChair, 18th century. Batavia.\nCollection of Gereja Sion (Portuguese Zion Church), Jakarta.\nIncreasingly, itinerant craftsmen of different nationalities offered their services in every port of call and were adept at producing work in a range of styles. Consequently, many categories of objects do not have clear provenance. The complexity, chaos and creativity of port cities reveals that globalisation and multicultural, hybrid environments are not new at all. Rather, they are a persistent and ancient phenomena.\nUltimately, they also raise deep questions about whether anything can or needs to be considered homogenous or pure.\nThe material culture of mixed-race communities illustrates this hybrid quality through the adaptation of new fashions and styles. Adaptation and use of the sarong kebaya by Peranakan nyonyas, for instance, reveals hybrid influences stretching from Europe and southern Africa through to the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia.\nKebaya.

This painting represents the earliest known dated portrait of a local painted by a Filipino artist. Paterno Molo belonged to an important Chinese- Filipino merchant family who were suppliers of Chinese goods destined for re-export in the Galleon Trade to New Spain. The family’s descendants are still prominent in Filipino society today. Portraits like this are indicative of the emergence of a native middle class, who conscious of their newly attained achievement and status, drove the demand for privately commissioned portraits during the mid-19th century. The barong tagalog is today considered one of the forms of national dress in the Philippines. In this picture, the high collar was inspired by Spanish outfits of the period.\nSeverino Flavier Pablo.

He was a laksa hawker living in Duxton Road. On hearing of this tragic incident, Seow Poh Leng, a concerned citizen, wrote an eight stanza poem in his article, “The Hapless Hawker: A Plea for Humane Treatment\". By Vidya Murthy, Researcher, National Museum of Singapore\nImages: National Museum of Singapore\nBeMuse Volume 3 Issue 3 - Jul to Sep 2010\nOn January 23, 1931, twenty-five year old Ng Chen committed suicide. He was a laksa hawker living in Duxton Road. On hearing of this tragic incident, Seow Poh Leng, a concerned citizen, wrote an eight stanza poem in his article, “The Hapless Hawker: A Plea for Humane Treatment”1. Making no claims to its literary merit, Seow hoped that his verse would “invoke the sympathy of the powers-that-be and of the public for voiceless, illiterate and the much-maligned Hawkers.” First printed in the Malaya Tribune, the article is included in the Report of the Committee Appointed to Investigate the Hawker Question in Singapore, 1931 (hereafter referred to as Report):\n\"We came from Cathay, the land of ancient renown\nTo try and earn a living in this far-famed modern town\nThough father and mother are old they still have to toil each day\nMy father selling bean-curds, mother selling “kway” [sic]\n.....\nGood-bye my parents dear, good bye my kith and kin!\nThink not the step I take an unpardonable sin\nI’ve not forgotten the lesson of filial piety’ . . .\nRather than become a criminal and sully the family name\nI drink this potion dark and prefer even death to shame.\"\nII\nIn the early 1900s, a cup of coffee with milk cost two cents on the street and three cents in a coffee shop. Satay sold on the five-foot way was about two cents a stick, and a bowl of Hokkien mee was ten cents. Every cent mattered then, because in 1908, a coolie earned about fifty cents and a rickshaw puller about two dollars a day. Rents for a cubicle on Sago Lane ranged from one and a half to four and a half dollars a month2. In the 1920s, with a capital of fifty cents, one could make about twenty cents3. But this money was hardly enough and by the 1930s, with the depression, the plight of the street hawkers was bad. For instance, in 1935, Liew Ah Chow was in distress as he could not afford medical treatment for his daughter. As a cobbler, he made about thirty to forty cents a day. On this money, he could not afford the ten dollars that the General Hospital charged as medical fees.\nDocuments such as the Report show the ways in which the administrators viewed the hawkers – as a problem that needed to be addressed. It appears that the main objections to the hawkers, especially the food vendors, were that they caused health problems through serving contaminated food, littered streets, obstructed traffic, posed unfair competition to shop keepers, corrupted the lower ranks of the Police and Municipality and were suspected to having connections with the Secret Societies.\nThe authors of the Report recognised that the hawkers were essential and that it was a means of livelihood, especially for the new immigrants4. They helped to distribute goods including fruits and vegetables for the retailers and provided cheap and efficient services. So, according to them, a total abolishing of these hawkers was not ideal, but it was important to reduce their numbers, keep them off the main streets and house them in dedicated shelters. Thus their recommendations involved controlling, regulating and monitoring the hawkers. One of the chief ways of doing this was through issuing of licenses.\nThe first proposal to license and set aside designated places for peddlers to hawk their wares was made in 1903 and it was at the behest of the Chinese Protectorate and the Municipality. The reason for this was that the Police found the hawkers a nuisance and an obstruction on the streets. In 1905 the Municipal Commissioner suggested that food hawkers must be registered. Following this, a series of regulations were instituted. This included licensing of Eating Shops and Coffee Houses in 1913 and the itinerant hawkers both by day and night in 1919.\nItinerant hawker's license no. 6017, issued to Yeo Jeah Siang, 1948.\nThe three institutions that were involved in ‘solving’ the hawker issues were: Police, the Municipality and the Health Officers. While the Health officers made stringent demands, the Police penalised offenders by seizing their goods and paraphernalia. Not all the rules were successful. Many stallholders who could not meet the health standards closed their shops. As a result, there was an increase in food hawkers on the streets. In 1931, at the time the Report was made, there were 6,043 licensed itinerant hawkers and an estimated 4000 unlicensed ones on the streets. There were six shelters housing 383 hawkers.\nIII\nThe colonial Report reveals the attitudes of the local elites and citizens such as Seow Poh Leng mentioned above. Included are the opinions of the members of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Teochew guilds, and the Straits Chinese British Association among others. While some favoured and sympathised with the hawkers and questioned the efficacy of licensing, others demanded that the hawkers be removed.\nNote for instance the opinion of R. Krishnan, editor of The Indian and representing The Indian Association5. He wanted the Indian ice-water seller off the streets. “I have no sympathy for him,” he says. “If he cannot be removed instantaneously, there should at least be a policy aiming at a quick abolition of this kind of hawkers. . . . Get hold of any ice-water hawker and inspect his fingers. And what do we see? Inflammation of his nail beds and not infrequently pus exuding from them... And it is with such fingers that he prepares his syrups or produces “ice-balls” for innocent school children! Again he is the root cause of the dental caries and gastric disturbances of the school going children in Singapore at least that is the strong feeling of Indian parents.”\nKrishnan does not spare the tea and ginger bun sellers, curry puff sellers, vendors of agar-agar or the curd sellers, all of whom belonged to various Indian communities. This perception that the food preparer and seller is an agent of disease is unequivocally established in a language of modernity6. If it resembles the attitude of the colonial administrator, it is not a co-incidence. His fear of contamination is not restricted to the seller but to the consumer as well. In a language that reads like a public health nightmare, he writes of the practice of eating off the same plate, “Incidentally the habit of eating off the same dish or plate, as a “satay” sellers’ table or at a Chinese stall contributes to the speedy spread of infections from one mouth to the other . . . that dreadful disease, syphilis, will easily, once the infection is passed, go the rounds by this means.”\nIn contrast to this negative perception, the itinerant traveller and photographers cast the street peddler as an exotic being. Moving the peddler out of the street and into the studio, the photographer posed him with the tools of his trade. Although removed from the grit and grind of labour, the hawker is presented as an embodiment of work. The picturesque effect becomes even more pronounced in the commercial prints and postcards that began to be produced for bourgeoisie consumption.\nIf the colonial photographer sought to romanticise the hawker, the adventure seeker was not far behind. In a 1931 account, a street barber is described in the following manner, “The barbers sit along the sidewalks, and in addition to shaving your face, a barber scrapes your tongue, and the same water is used over and over again. He also, with funny little instruments, cleans your eyes, ears and nose”7. These remarks are revealing. Despite the fascination of the Orient, the traveller cannot help but reveal his own deep-seated cultural attitude to dirt and hygiene.\nBarber, 1938.\nBarber\nIV\nWho were the street peddlers? What became of them? These questions might never be fully answered as there are no first person accounts available. There are various types of sources that explore the economic and social conditions of street life in the late 19th and early 20th century. Among them are histories of the working class, accounts left behind by travellers, and colonial records. Following the classic 1963 study by the anthropologist, Clifford Geertz, economists and city planners began to take notice of street traders8. Economists have examined street hawkers in urban cities such as Hong Kong and Jakarta among others9.\nThe studies of Singapore’s street peddlers, especially food vendors, have to be located in the corpus of this larger discourse10. Visual records such as drawings, illustrations and fictional representations of the working class can also be considered. For instance, classic studies such as Samuel Victor Contant’s 1936 work Calls, Sounds and Merchandise of the Peking Street Peddlers is a wonderful study which analyses the language the hawkers’ use and carries charming coloured drawings.\nThe well-known novel, Rickshaw (Lo-T’O Hsiang Tzu), set in Shanghai in the turn of the century, offers a compelling portrait of misery and destitution of street workers and their lives11. However, such an account of Singapore’s street people in the early 20th century is yet to be written. Still, there exists, in the National Museum collections, a wealth of materials including photographs, postcards and some associated material culture such as tools and objects.\nPeddling of goods and services in the late 19th and early 20th century was tied to migration and kinship networks. Predominant among the street hawkers were the Chinese, Indians, Malays and some Jews. The Chinese were identified largely by their dialect groups included the Cantonese Hockchias, Hockchius, Hokkiens, Shanghainese and Teochews among others. They sold coffee, cooked food, fresh produce, fish, and meats such as pork. Among the Cantonese, there were also women who took to peddling goods, toys, and cigarettes. The Shanghainese sold silk.\nPeddlers from the Indian communities sold bread, fried snacks, yoghurt, milk and iced-water.\nStreet side hawkers selling bread, c. 1940.\nDonated by Mr. Thomas Kennett\nAmong the people of the Malay Archipelago, the Javanese peddled curios and cloth, while the Malays sold satay. Although the hawkers could be found all over the town as some of were itinerant, many of them operated in the central areas. These areas specified by the municipal authorities included largely the southeast part of the island around the Singapore River. The hawkers tended to work along common dialect or language groups.\nFor instance the Hokkiens who were the largest group of Chinese hawkers could be found everywhere especially around China Street, Hokkien Street and Telok Ayer Street. That they mostly operated in the municipal areas became a major sore point with the colonial administrators.\nChinese Street, Singapore\nThe exhibition, Surviving the Streets: Peddlers and Artisans in Early-Mid 20th Century Singapore, was about these people who made a living on the streets and five-foot ways. Their lives on the streets highlighted not only disparities between class and race but also the conflicting perceptions between the colonial government and the people. However, through their day to day economic transactions, these individuals forged lasting relationships among themselves and with the spaces in which they operated. That is, the exhibition attempted to define peddlers as not just producers of work. Instead through a selection of artefacts including tools and images of leisure, the display hoped to show that the street vendors were social beings who transformed the world they inhabited in meaningful ways\nSurviving the Streets: Peddlers and Artisans in Early-Mid 20th Century Singapore was an exhibition curated by the author. It was on at the Balcony, National Museum of Singapore from 28 June to 22 August 2010. More than a hundred artefacts drawn from the National Museum’s collections were displayed along five themes: The Street and the Image, Artisans and Tools, Postcards and Peddlers, Services, Leisure and Social Life. Three video footages of craftsmen, two audio clips of interviews and a selection of folk songs were also included in the display.\nNotes", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/street-hawkers-of-singapores-past/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/street-hawkers-of-singapores-past/streethawkersofsingaporespast4.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:05:59"},

It is located near Al-Abrar Mosque, Former Nagore Dargah, and Telok Ayer Chinese Methodist Church, standing on what used to be the shoreline of Telok Ayer Basin. Location\nNational Monuments sksks\n158 Telok Ayer Street, Singapore 068613\nGet Directions\nThian Hock Keng (天福宫, ‘Palace of Heavenly Happiness’) is one of Singapore’s oldest Hokkien temples. It is located near Al-Abrar Mosque, Former Nagore Dargah, and Telok Ayer Chinese Methodist Church, standing on what used to be the shoreline of Telok Ayer Basin. In addition to its religious function, Thian Hock Keng is also a standing monument to the community spirit of Chinese pioneers in Singapore.\nA Temple for All Tangren\nThe temple’s history began when the first Chinese immigrants disembarked on the shore of Telok Ayer Basin, which lay along the present-day Telok Ayer Street. Upon their arrival, the Chinese – many from Fujian Province, China – visited a little shrine just in front of the shoreline to give thanks to Mazu (妈祖), Goddess of Seas, for their safe voyage. As the number of Chinese immigrants increased over the years, it was decided that a permanent temple should be built to replace the makeshift shrine.\nConstruction of the new temple began in 1839 and was completed three years later. All the building materials were imported from China, and the intricate carvings and decorations were all crafted by artisans who hailed from Fujian Province. The total building cost was estimated to be 30,000 Spanish dollars. Donations came mainly from wealthy Hokkien businessmen and community leaders.\nInscribed on a granite tablet set in the wall of the entrance hall is a list of donors who contributed to the construction. Tan Tock Seng (陈笃生), a Malaccan-born pioneer and well-known philanthropist, was recorded to have given a handsome sum of 3,000 Spanish dollars and was the largest contributor of funds. While Thian Hock Keng is largely associated with the Hokkien community, it is evident from the same stele that the founding committee had desired it to be a temple for all tangren (唐人), that is, Chinese from all dialect groups.\nDeities\nThe statue of Mazu in the temple was brought from China and enshrined as the chief deity following a grand procession in 1840. Other deities installed in the temple include Baosheng Dadi (保生大帝, invoked as the God of Medicine and Health), Guansheng Dijun (关圣帝君, worshipped for spiritual protection), Confucius (孔子, a favourite among students and their parents), and the Goddess of Mercy (观音菩萨). These deities clearly reveal the ardent desires of early Chinese immigrants settling in their new home.\nHokkien Huay Kuan\nIn 1840, a group of prominent Chinese philanthropists established Hokkien Huay Kuan (福建会馆, ‘Hokkien Association’) within the compound of Thian Hock Keng. The association’s main objectives included promoting education among the local Chinese community, providing social welfare and aid to new immigrants from Fujian Province, as well as upholding Chinese language, culture, and values. Even today, the association continues to play an important role in contributing towards the society at large.\nArchitecture and Furnishings\nBuilt in the traditional Hokkien architectural style, Thian Hock Keng features curved roof ridges with distinctive upturned ‘swallow tail’ end sweeps. On the roofs of the entrance hall and the main hall, four dancing dragons symbolising justice and power flank a blazing pearl representing immortality and perfection. The decorative elements on the roofs were made using a special technique called jian nian (剪粘), which literally means ‘cut and paste’. Colourful ceramics were meticulously cut into smaller pieces and pasted to create beautiful mosaic figures. Such ornamentation can also be found in other temples in Singapore, such as Tan Si Chong Su, Yueh Hai Ching Temple, Hong San See, and Lian Shan Shuang Lin Monastery.\nLike many Chinese temples, Thian Hock Keng has the standard layout of a three-hall typology, comprising an entrance hall, a main hall, and a rear hall. In addition, it has additional rows of side halls on either side of the primary prayer halls.\nThere is a plaque and scroll in the main hall which is inscribed with calligraphy bestowed by Emperor Guangxu of Qing China in 1907. It reads bo jing nan ming (波靖南溟), which can be translated as ‘gentle waves on the southern seas’. Yueh Hai Ching Temple is the only other temple in Singapore that also received a similar imperial favour.\nChongwen Ge\nIn the past, two institutions flanked Thian Hock Keng: Chongwen Ge (崇文阁, ‘Institute for the Veneration of Literature’), Singapore’s first Chinese school; and Keng Teck Whay (庆德会), a private Straits Chinese self-help association. In 1849, an outstanding Hokkien Peranakan merchant, Tan Kim Seng (陈金声), spearheaded the construction of Chongwen Ge. Besides the Hokkiens, members of the Hakka and Teochew communities also contributed generously to the project. Originally, Chongwen Ge comprised the Chongwen Pagoda and Chong Boon Gate. Chong Hock Pavilion was added in 1913.\nHaving outgrown its facility within the temple grounds, Hokkien Huay Kuan moved into Chong Hock Pavilion in 1915. That same year, it established Chong Hock Girls’ School (崇福女校), one of Singapore’s earliest Chinese schools for girls. The name ‘Chong Hock’ (崇福) was an honorary title given to Mazu in the imperial court during the Song Dynasty (960–1279).\nThian Hock Keng Today\nThe temple remains an important place of worship among local Chinese Buddhists and Taoists. Between 1998 and 2000, Thian Hock Keng underwent a major restoration which earned it an honourable mention in the UNESCO Asia-Pacific Heritage 2001 Awards for Cultural Heritage Conservation.\nThian Hock Keng and Chongwen Ge were gazetted collectively as a National Monument.\nOur National Monuments\nOur National Monuments are an integral part of Singapore’s built heritage, which the National Heritage Board (NHB) preserves and promotes for posterity. They are monuments and sites that are accorded the highest level of protection in Singapore.\nThian Hock Keng", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/places/places-landing/Places/national-monuments/thian-hock-keng", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/monuments/067-thian-hock-keng/thian-hock-keng-temple-01.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:06:01"},

Text by Lucille Yap\nBeMuse Volume 5 Issue 4 - Oct to Dec 2012\nSingapore and Thailand share close historical ties dating back to the 13th century when Singapore was under the Malay sultanate. The opening of the Kingdom of Siam (now Kingdom of Thailand) to foreign trade from 1855 drew Singapore closer to Siam via trade.\n1997 Singapore-Thailand Joint Stamp Issue from Singapore and Thailand.\nSingapore received the first royal visit from the Kingdom of Siam when His Majesty King Chulalongkorn made his first overseas visit as king to Singapore in 1871. It was during this period when Siam studied how Singapore, then a British colony, was administered, including its economic and social affairs, as well as the postal system. The advancement of the British postal system in Singapore inspired the Kingdom of Siam to introduce and develop the postal system in Siam. The first post office and stamp issue for Siam was inaugurated on 4 August 1883.\n1995, 120th anniversary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs featuring His Majesty King Chulalongkorn.\nSingapore – A Postal Hub\nSince its establishment as a trading post in 1819 by the British East India Company, Singapore was a postal and communication hub for states and countries in Southeast Asia. All written correspondence from countries in this region with the rest of the world, and vice versa, was done via Singapore. Incoming and outgoing foreign mail to and from Southeast Asian countries were collected in Singapore before being forwarded to their destinations.\nLocated at the crossroads of international shipping routes, Singapore’s unique geographical position placed it in a position to influence the postal arrangements of neighbouring countries – many of which followed this British settlement’s postal system closely when introducing new postal systems and extending old ones. The Kingdom of Siam was no exception.\nSingapore continued to serve as an important collecting and forwarding hub until late 1800s when its neighbouring countries became members of the Universal Postal Union (UPU). As members of the UPU, which was established in 1874, they were able to send and receive international mail directly to and from foreign countries without having to route their mail to Singapore.\nModernising Siam\nSiam was known to be a great entrepot centre in the 17th century. However, its efforts in diplomatic and commercial relations with foreign and Western countries were put to a halt by Burmese invasion in 1767. Although Burma did not retain control of Siam for long, Siam closed its door to the outside world and spent more than a hundred years to restore and reunite the country.\nSiam began to resume external contacts during the reign of His Majesty King Nang Klao (Rama III 1824 - 1851). He reopened relations with Western nations and established trade with China. But it was during the reign of His Majesty King Mongkut (Rama IV 1851 - 1868) and later His Majesty King Chulalongkorn (Rama V 1868 - 1910) that Siam underwent tremendous transformation.\nDiplomacy, Sovereignty and Modernisation\nFaced with the pressure and threat of Western imperialist powers’ advances in colonising states and countries around Siam, King Mongkut kept these Western powers at bay by signing treaties with several European countries. United Kingdom was the first to succeed in signing a treaty with Siam in 1855. Signed by King Mongkut and Sir John Bowring, the Bowring Treaty in essence allowed foreigners to trade freely in Bangkok without the heavy royal taxes imposed on trade. The constructive treaty put Siam’s foreign relations on a positive note at a time when resistance was met with force. The Bowring Treaty set the tone of non-interference in Siamese affairs and respect for Thai independence, which was also observed by other Western powers.\nOutgoing letters sent from Bangkok to San Francisco to France via Singapore.\nSource: Collection of Dr Prakob Chirakiti.\nThe Bowring Treaty resulted in an increasing volume of trade between Singapore and Siam. Rice exports formed the biggest part of this trade. With the signing of more treaties with other foreign powers, trade grew by leaps and bounds. For example, ships visiting Bangkok from Singapore more than doubled, from 146 in 1850 to 302 in 1862. The total annual value of trade also rose from about 5.6 million baht in 1850 to about 10 million baht by 1868.\nCapitalising on the good relationship with the Western powers, King Mongkut studied their form of government, administration, as well as their social and economic affairs. He undertook many social and economic reforms to modernise Siam.\nHis Majesty King Mongkut (Rama IV).\nKing Chulalongkorn continued his father’s tradition of reform, abolishing slavery and improving the public welfare and administrative systems.\n2005 stamp commemorating a century of abolition of slavery in Thailand, which was part of His Majesty King Chulalongkorn's reform.\nSingapore – An Inspiration to Siam\nSingapore was the British centre in the region. There were many visits between British and Siamese officials. In 1861, King Mongkut sent Chao Phraya Sri Suriyawongse Juang Bunnag and Prince Krommamun Vishnunarth Nibhadhorn to study how Singapore was administered. As a result, modern technology such as the construction of roads and bridges was brought to Siam.\nDuring the start of the reign of King Chulalongkorn, the progress of Singapore, Java and India had deeply impressed the young king. British and Dutch colonial government and administration – not the states in Europe – were his models. There are two main periods of reform during his reign: the first from 1873 to 1874; and the second, after 1892. The reforms were related to his travels to Singapore and Java in 1871 and his subsequent visits to these same places in 1896 and 1901.\nIn 1881, with a view to establish post offices in the kingdom, an officer was sent to Singapore to gain insight into the postal system. Siam hoped to establish direct postal communication with the rest of the world, and there was no post office in the kingdom at that time.\nIntroduction of Postal System in Siam\nBritish Consulate in Bangkok\nThe signing of treaties between Siam and foreign countries allowed these countries to establish their consulates in Siam. The need to communicate via letters and correspondence with other consulates and with their home countries stressed the need for a postal system. At that time, there was no postal service in Siam. The people of Siam sent letters through messengers or friends who were travelling within or out of the country.\nCode of Arms of British Consulate in Bangkok used as postal cancellation.\nIn 1867, the British Consulate was the first entity in Siam to introduce the system of post. With that, all international mailing services were provided by and dependent on the British Consulate.\nPost Office at the British Consulate on Charoenkrung Road.\nStraits Settlements Stamps Used in Bangkok\nWhen the British Consulate Post Office was set up in Bangkok, Siam did not have its own stamp. British India stamps, which were also used in the Straits Settlements (Malacca, Penang and Singapore), were used by the British Consulate Post Office until 1867 when they were replaced by Straits Settlements stamps.\nDuring this early period, outbound mail must be sent out from Bangkok to Singapore, and thereafter forwarded to other countries. The letters and packages were thus cancelled in Singapore with Singapore postmarks. This practice continued until 1 July 1885 when Siam joined the UPU which coordinates the international postal system, and started its own international postal services.\nStraits Settlements Stamps Overprinted with ‘B’\nIn April 1882, the branch of the Singapore post office established in Bangkok was permitted by the United Kingdom to operate postal services in the city, as sending messages was in great demand. The Straits Settlements stamps were overprinted with the Roman alphabet ‘B’, which stood for ‘Bangkok’, the place from where the letters were mailed.\nStraits Settlements stamps overprinted with 'B' used in Bangkok.\nAfter Siam started operating its own postal services in 1883 and became a member country of the UPU on 1 July 1885, the British postal services in Siam and the use of the stamps printed with the letter ‘B’ were terminated.\nLocal Stamps for Palace Use\nIn 1875, when the British Consulate was still offering postal services in Siam, His Royal Highness Prince Bhanurangsi Sawangwongse, King Chulalongkorn’s younger brother, published a daily newspaper named ‘COURT’ or ‘Government News’ with a group of the royal family’s members. The newspaper was distributed by dispatch to high-ranking officials and close members of the royal family, and Prince Bhanurangsi Sawangwongse issued a stamp as evidence of payment for the delivery service. This stamp, referred to as ‘Local Stamp’, featured a portrait of Prince Bhanurangsi Sawangwongse. They were also used for letters sent to a specific area.\n2009, His Royal Highness Prince Bhanurangsi, Director-General of the Post and Telegraph Department.\nThe 'Rising P', a single one-Att stamp was affixed on each copy of the Court Circular as a fee for its delivery within the metropolis' walls, and two stamps were affixed if delivered outside the metropolis' walls.\nFollowing this, Prince Bhanurangsi issued another series of stamps printed in England named ‘The Royal Family’. It was used only by members of the royal family in communicating government news.\nSiamese Postal System\nIn 1880, Chao Muen Samerjairaj, a courtier who had seen the postal system in foreign countries, made an appeal to King Chulalongkorn to establish a postal system in Siam for the benefits of the general public and the government.\nChao Muen Samerjairat lodged a letter of appeal to His Majesty King Chulalongkorn, requesting for a Royal Decree to establish a postal system in Bangkok.\nHe said:\n“It is important indeed for the trading in accordance with the international practice to know exactly where to receive and send the correspondences, which is called postal service, and this will be beneficial to the nation and other countries as well.”\nOn 2 July 1881, King Chulalongkorn appointed Prince Bhanurangsi as Director-General of the Post and Telegraph Department. It was a rather challenging endeavour for the prince, as the postal services were very new in the Siamese society. The registration of house numbers and last names had not commenced at that time. Moreover, a number of people disagreed with the project, fearing that it might not worth the investment.\nInauguration of the Postal System\nOn 4 August 1883, Prince Bhanurangsi, Director-General of the Post and Telegraph Department, proclaimed the inauguration of postal services, which would be on trial within the area of Bangkok. Letters were accepted and sent within the city.\nAfter 48 days, the overwhelming number of Siamese people using the services at the post office amazed King Chulalongkorn. The king mentioned the postal services in the Royal speech on his birthday on 20 September 1883:\n“ I had no idea that the Siamese use letters in this huge amount ... Post Office providing the services of receiving and delivering mails within Bangkok surprises me due to the fact that the Siamese use a great amount of letters. This inspired me to expand the service throughout the Kingdom for the benefit of trading and correspondence of government sector. Later, I hope to invite the Director-General of Germany Postal Service and apply for a membership of Postal Union, which will allow for Siamese Postal Service to operate the mailing service around the world.”\nFirst Stamp Issue in Siam\nSiam issued its first set of postage stamps on 4 August 1883. The stamps, known as ‘Solot’, featured the portrait of King Chulalongkorn. Intended for domestic use only, the stamps bore no country name. They were designed by Mr William Ridgeway, an English designer and engraver, and were printed by the Waterlow & Sons Printing C Ltd, England.\nSolot, the first stamp issue of Thailand, had six denominations: 1 Solot, 1 Att, 1 Sio, 1 Sik, 1 Salung and 1 Fuang.\nWhen Siam joined the UPU on 1 July 1885, stamps were issued and designed in accordance with the UPU regulations, so that they could be used both within the country and overseas. The word ‘SIAM’ was added and denominations were in both Thai and Arabic numerals.\nWith these changes, the use of British Straits Settlements stamps for outbound mail was no longer needed. This led to the closure of the British Consulate Post Office in Bangkok.\nLucille Yap is Senior Curator, Singapore Philatelic Museum.", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/the-postal-connection-singapore-and-thailand/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/the-postal-connection-singapore-and-thailand/the-postal-connection-singapore-and-thailand-1.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:06:02"},

Rhino cups were also called libation cups, as they may have been used as wedding cups by the bride and the groom on their wedding night. blanc de Chine or ‘white of ‘China’, is a French term for the porcelain that Europeans imported from China during the 16th and 17th centuries.", "comments": "Gift of Frank and Pamela Hickley", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/Collection-Landing/listing/1136996", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/CollectionImages/1136996.jpg", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:06:02"},

The organisation established multiple branches over the years. In 1942, they established a branch in Balestier which relocated to Toa Payoh in 1958. The year after, they established another branch in Upper Bukit Timah which relocated to Jurong East in 1986.\nThe main temple was established by Chen Si Shun, Wu Li Sheng, Yang Yong Chao, and Chen Rong An in a shophouse at River Valley Road in 1916. In the years after its establishment, the temple moved several times. It moved to Tanglin, New Market Road, and after the war, it relocated again to a bigger premise at North Boat Quay. Finally, in 1982, Seu Teck Sean Tong temple settled down at Bedok North Avenue 3.\nModern Construction with Traditional Emblems\nThe compound consists of three main buildings of modern reinforced concrete architecture with Chinese traditional features. To the left of the compound is the Main Prayer Hall, and on the right is the Ancestral Hall. Both halls are in double storey buildings and are linked to the four-storey Zuo Zhuah Building (佐泉樓).\nTraditional features are integrated into the otherwise modern building. Pitch roofs with green glazed tiles, a pseudo Dou-gong “斗拱” underneath the roof eaves, sculptures and ornamentations of mythical auspicious animals and objects are some of the traditional emblems encompassed into the temple’s design. The boundary walls are made of fair-faced red bricks, green glazed roof, ventilation blocks and bars.\nThe traditional Chinese style entrance gateway is a prominent feature at the front boundary wall facing Bedok North Avenue 3. This moon gate is located between the two halls. Above the gate is written Shan Ren “善忍” which respectively means “benevolence” and “endurance”.\nThe present temple mainly worships Reverend Song Ta-Fung who left behind a noble legacy in Teochew history. It also continues to provide free Traditional Chinese Medical services to the public.\nBuildings and sites featured on Roots.SG are part of our efforts to raise awareness of our heritage; a listing on Roots.SG does not imply any form of preservation or conservation status, unless it is mentioned in the article.

Text by Lucille Yap\nBeMuse Volume 4 Issue 2 – Apr to Jun 2011\nAviation history was made on 16 March 1911. On this day, the first aircraft took flight in Singapore, when a Bristol Boxkite biplane piloted by Joseph Christiaens rose into the air from the old Race Course at Farrer Park. It was a flight demonstration at the first aviation meet held in Singapore. To mark the centenary of this historic occasion, the Singapore Philatelic Museum opened an exhibition titled Singapore Takes Flight: A Hundred Years. Running from 11 March till September 2011, this exhibition celebrated the milestone event with picture postcards, postage stamps and first day covers alongside a private collection of model aircraft on loan from Mr Ralph Aeria. An award-winning philatelic collection, Malayan Airmail 1911-1942, from Mr Lim Sa Bee was also displayed from end March to June 2011.\nThe Bristol aircraft\nThe Plane and The Pilot\nThe Bristol Boxkite was a modified version of the Henri Farman biplane, a famous and widely used model produced in France and first flown in 1909. Seating two, the Boxkite was developed by the British and Colonial Aeroplane Company, a Bristol-based company that was later renamed the Bristol Aeroplane Company.\nThe first Boxkite flew on 29 July 1910. It was put into production, in significant numbers for the time, at Britain’s first aircraft factory in Filton, Bristol. A highly successful aircraft, the Boxkite soon drew the attention of the British War Office which placed an order for four aircraft. This was followed by orders from the Australian Army, India and Russia. The Boxkite was used extensively as an elementary training aircraft.\nIn 1964, three Boxkite replicas were built with modern engines by F.G. Miles Engineering Ltd for the Twentieth Century Fox film Those Magnificent Men and their Flying Machines, which was very successful at the box office. An Australian project team, known as Project 2014, has reconstructed the Boxkite to commemorate the centenary of the first military flight in Australia on 1 March 2014.\nThe pilot of Singapore’s virgin flight, Joseph Christiaens, was an engineer, race car driver and aviator born to a well-to-do family near Brussels in Belgium in 1879. In March 1910, Christiaens learned to fly in a Henri Farman airplane and in the following month, was registered with Belgian Pilot License #7, becoming one of the first 11 aviators registered at the Aero Club of Belgium. Thereafter, he took part in a number of aviation meetings racing Henri Farman’s plane in Europe in 1910.\nIn 1911, Joseph Christiaens, with his brother Armaud, made a tour of the East Indies, taking with him two Bristol Boxkite biplanes. An avid car racer, he died on 25 February 1919 in a road accident while testing a racing car in England. His speeding car crashed into a wall while trying to avoid a horse-cart emerging out of a side road.\nFrom Race Course to International Aviation Route\nBuilt in 1842 by members of the Singapore Sporting Club, the old Race Course at Farrer Park served as a sports and recreational hub for European residents. Although the race course moved to new premises in Bukit Timah in 1933, the road name “Race Course Road” continues to serve as a reminder of its early equestrian heritage.\nSome early postcards of the Race Course at Farrer Park. The first postcard shows Captain Ross Smith after he landed in Singapore.\nEight years after Christiaens’ historic flight in his Boxkite, the Race Course saw action once more when a Vickers Vimy G-EAOU piloted by Captain Ross Smith landed for a stopover on 4 December 1919. Captain Ross had flown 22 days and 13,900 km from England and was en route to Darwin, Northern Australia. He completed his 135-hour journey on 10 December 1919.\nStamps commemorating the first Vickers Vimy flight from England to Australia and the first trans-Atlantic flight.\n\"I glided the Vimy down at as low a speed as possible, and just before we touched the ground.... The next day, December 4, was my birthday, and to reach Australia within the specified thirty-day time limit meant that we had to arrive in Darwin on the 12th, eight days from now, and four more landings to make after leaving Singapore. Thus it will be seen we still had four days in hand. I therefore decided to remain the whole of next day at Singapore and work on our machine. ... The heat in Singapore was intense and, coming from the cold of the English winter, we felt it severely.\"\n- From London to Australia by Aeroplane, A Personal Narrative of the First Aerial Voyage Half Around the World” by Sir Ross Smith, published in The National Geographic Magazine, March 1921\nPostcard showing crowds flocking towards the Vickers Vimy biplane after it had landed at Farrer Park.\nThe beginning of 1930s saw the rapid expansion of air routes connecting Europe to the Far East. The Dutch airline, KLM (the Dutch abbreviation of Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij or Royal Dutch Airlines), placed Alor Star, Singapore and Penang on the international aviation route map in 1931, 1933 and 1936 respectively. Singapore’s first direct link with Europe was established on 3 May 1933 when a KLM Fokker F-18 put the island on the trunk route between Amsterdam and Batavia (now Jakarta).\nAt the end of 1934, Imperial Airways, the first British commercial long-range air transport company, established its England-Australia link with Singapore as a key stopover point. Qantas Empire Airways took over the Singapore-Australia sector in 1935.\n(From left to right) Qantas Flight Cover commemorating the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, 3 June 1953.

BOAC Comet Jetliner First Flight Cover from Singapore to London, UK, 1959.\nQantas Empire Airways plane\nAfter the Second World War, jetliners with greater speed and capacity replaced propeller-driven aircraft. The first jet to arrive in Singapore was a British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) Comet in 1951. Produced by de Havilland, a British aviation company, the Comet was the world’s first commercial jet airliner with a sleek aerodynamic body, pressurised cabin and seating up to 36 passengers. Unfortunately, the plane was unable to land at Kallang Airport due to runway limitations and so landed at the Changi Royal Air Force airfield instead. Airmail was delivered to Singapore for the first time by jet plane in 1951.\nFrom Civil Aerodrome to Changi International Airport\nFrom 1928, small land aircraft and seaplanes were handled at the military airbase of the Royal Air Force at Seletar. Growth in air traffic in the early 1930s, however, prompted the call for a new civilian airport facility. Then Governor of the Straits Settlements Sir Cecil Clementi expressed on 31 August 1931 his opinion in words that would prove prophetic in the later decades of the century:\n\"It is a not a question of which aerodrome in Singapore Island would be the cheapest but which aerodrome in Singapore Island would be the best. Looking into the future, I expect to see Singapore become one of the largest and most important airports of the world... It is, therefore, essential that we should have here, close to the heart of town, an aerodrome which is equally suitable for land planes and for sea planes; and the best site, beyond all question, is the Kallang Basin.\"\nWork on this massive reclamation task began in 1932. Kallang Airport was officially opened by the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir Thomas Shenton, on 12 June 1937. It was praised as the finest airport in the British Empire.\nRegional aviation continue to expand, with the launch of the first internal air service in Malaya, Wearne’s Air Service, on 28 June 1937, which flew three times a week from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur and Penang.\nWearne's First Flight Cover from Penang to Singapore, 28 June 1937. Malayan First Day Air Service Cover from Singapore to Penang, 28 June 1937. Maxicard of Paya Lebar Airport. 2008 Singapore Changi Airport Terminal 3. 1981 Singapore Changi Airport Miniature Sheet.\nAdvances in aviation technology after the Second World War led to the development of bigger and faster civil aircraft. The inability of Kallang Airport to accommodate the Comet led to the extension and strengthening of the runway, but it was becoming apparent that a new civil airport was necessary. Construction thus began in 1952 of the Paya Lebar Airport, which was completed on 20 August 1955 and officially opened by then Chief Minister of Singapore, David Marshall, with British Colonial Secretary, Alan Lennox-Boyd, as guest-of-honour.\nAfter independence, Singapore’s growing role as an international trading hub and tourism destination led to the construction of Changi International Airport. The first phase, completed in 1981, included a runway, 45 aircraft parking bays, a passenger terminal, a maintenance hangar, a fire station, workshops and administrative offices, an airfreight complex, cargo agent buildings, in-flight catering kitchens and a 78-metre high control tower. Changi International Airport began operations on 1 July 1981 and was officially opened on 29 December 1981.\nThe airport later expanded with the addition of Terminal 2 which became operational on 22 November 1990 and was officially opened on 1 June 1991. Further expansion took place in 2008 with the opening of Terminal 3, which was designed to handle the gigantic Airbus A380, on 9 January 2008. The recent boom in budget air travel saw the addition of a separate Budget Terminal which began operations on 26 March 2006. Terminal 4 was also officially opened on 31 October 2017 with self-check-in and automated bag drop facilities. Jewel Changi Airport, a commercial development, and Terminal 5 are due to open in 2019 and the late 2020s respectively.\nA Century of Plane Delights\nThe history of Singapore’s national airlines, which began in May 1947, is illustrated in a 2003 Aircraft Stamp Series. The stamps trace the development of our national airlines from Malayan Airways to Singapore Airlines, and their aircraft through the decades, from the light twin-engine Airspeed Consul to modern day Jumbos, Concordes, and Airbuses.\nIn February 2006, the first Airbus A380 in full Singapore Airlines livery was flown to Singapore. On 25 October the following year, the first commercial A380 service, SQ380, carried 455 passengers from Singapore to Sydney. Regular services with the A380 began on 28 October 2007. Thus, history was made once more as a French-assembled giant soared over Singapore, drawing countless eyes to the sky nearly a century after the first fateful flight by a Belgian in a biplane over the city’s former race course.\nLucille Yap is a Senior Curator at the Singapore Philatelic Museum\nMan’s Quest to Fly\nThe flight of birds has fascinated mankind for ages. Our quest to soar like the birds had led to many fantasies and inventions that would aid humans to ‘fly’.\nFor centuries, humans have tried to fly like birds and studied avian flight. Wings, made of feathers or lightweight wood, were attached to arms to test their ability to take to the air. The results were often disastrous, as the muscles of the human arms are incomparable to those of birds. Kites were important to the invention of flight as they were the forerunners to balloons and gliders. Since 400 BCE, kites have been used by the Chinese in religious ceremonies. In 1000 BCE, the Chinese were reported to have used kites for in warfare, carrying men as spies and dropping firebombs over enemy territory. This practice was witnessed by the Venetian merchant-traveller Marco Polo (1254-1324) in the 1300s when he was in China. There are very reliable records of human attempts to fly until the early medieval times when the so-called tower jumpers appeared in force. Few of these courageous but perhaps misguided men were successful in their flying endeavours and in surviving their feats.\nBetween 1488 and 1514, the Italian inventor Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) made the first real studies of flight. He left over 100 drawings that illustrated his theories on bird and mechanical flight. The drawings show the wings and tails of birds, ideas for human-carrying machines, and devices for the testing of wings.\nThe Ornithopter, a flying machine drawn by Leonardo da Vinci, was designed to be powered by a combination of leg and arm movements activated by mean of mechanical devices. The machine was never actually created.\nLeonardo da Vinci soon learned to imitate the way birds glide rather than use human-powered wing motion. He designed and built winged gliders for human use.\nThe 18th century saw the emergence of hot air balloons with proponents like the Montgolfier brothers, Joseph-Michel (1740-1810) and Jacques-Étienne (1745-1799). The French siblings used smoke from a fire to blow hot air into a silk bag, which was then attached to a basket. The Montgolfiers first sent people up in hot air balloons with a manned flight on 21 November 1783.\nEnglish engineer, Sir George Cayley (1773– 1857), is considered the father of aerodynamics, which is the study of the movement of objects through the air. In 1804, he built the world’s first successful model glider which was successfully flown by a young boy. In 1853, Cayley reshaped the glider’s wing and added a tail to help with the stability.\nThe German Otto Lilienthal (1848-1896) made the first true controlled flights, gliding up to a distance of 230 metres. He experimented with various monoplane and biplane gliders which resembled giant bats. After more than 2,500 flights, Lilienthal was killed when he lost control during a sudden strong gust of wind and crashed into the ground.\nThe American Wright Brothers, Wilbur and Orville, constructed the first powered airplane, the ‘Flyer’, in the summer of 1903. Piloted by Wilbur, the Flyer attempted its maiden flight on 14 December 1903 in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, USA. This attempt was not successful. The brothers tried again three days later. This time piloted by Orville, the Flyer lifted itself into the air at 10.35 am. Although the flight lasted only 12 seconds and covered a distance of just 37 metres, it was the first self-powered, manned, heavier-than-air controlled flight in history.", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/singapore-takes-flight-a-hundred-years-of-aviation/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/singapore-takes-flight-a-hundred-years-of-aviation/singapore-takes-flight-cover.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:06:04"},

Masks take on supernatural powers and lizards grow big enough to swallow a goat without much effort. This is Indonesia or “Islands of the Indies”, a vast archipelago located at the crossroads of the traditional spice route between the Indian and Pacific Oceans.\nLand of Dance and Dragon was a discovery of Indonesia through its dances. This exhibition at the Singapore Philatelic Museum explored one of the greatest demonstrations of skill, art devotion and culture – the living tradition of dance. To portray characters and animals, performers don masks and elaborate costumes to narrate anecdotes of history, epic tales as well as current affairs. What started as a ritual performed for the gods to ask for protection against calamity still survives today. The dances, masks and costumes are diverse and varied but the quest for a peaceful life is common throughout the length of the archipelago.\nPandawa Brothers, East Java, c1990.\n“Islands of the Indies”\nWith a total land area of 1,919,317 square kilometres, Indonesia spans the equator between continental Asia and Australia and consists of over 13,000 islands, of which only 6,000 are inhabited. There are five main islands – Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Irian Jaya – and two smaller archipelagos: Nusa Tenggara and the Maluku Islands.\nMain Image: Beach in Flores, East Nusa Tenggara, Photo by Kiat.\nStamps: Borobudur Ship Expedition\nThe country has over 240 million people speaking many regional languages and dialects and practising many of the world’s major religions. Trade thrived in this region as early as the seventh century. During the rule of the Srivijayan (CE 700 – 1300) and later Majapahit (CE 1293 – 1500) empires, Indonesia traded with China and India. Through the same channels, Hinduism and Buddhism were introduced. Around 13th century, Islam arrived with Arab traders. European countries fought among themselves for control of the spice islands of Maluku. Dutch colonial powers (CE 1602 – 1942) then ruled Indonesia for three and a half centuries till after World War II.\nIndonesia displays an amazing array of cultural forms. It has been said that in Indonesia – art and life are intertwined. To observe the formal study of dance is to understand the history and culture of the country: its music, religion, literature, sculpture and architecture. Indonesian culture is a rich blend of heritage, living tradition and modern art. Monuments provide the built heritage. Traditional theatres of shadow puppets or human actors form the living tradition, and contemporary painting, sculpture, drama and dance inject modernism.\nDance – A Living Tradition\nDance in Indonesia serves as more than entertainment and recreation. Many dances have a religious significance. They are performed to honour ancestors, in traditional ceremonies like weddings, births and deaths as well as yearly activities like harvesting. There are as many dances as there are provinces in the country. Within each province, there are many types and variations of dances. Although the dances mentioned here are but a small selection, their importance to the fabric of society cannot be denied.\nTraditional ceremonial dances are still practised in Bali especially during the Galungan and Kuningan festivals. Galungan is a Balinese holiday that occurs every 210 days and lasts for 10 days, whereas Kuningan is the last day of the holiday. During this time, the Balinese gods are believed to visit the Earth. In Kalimantan, the Dayak people perform the tari mandau (sabre dance) which mimics the trailblazing action of clearing the forest. This dance which symbolises the fighting spirit of the people are performed during special ceremonial days. The Sanghyang trance dance is presented in Bali to ward off evil spirits. Java has a similar trance dance called Kuda Kepang.\nHudoq, Kalimantan, c1990.\nOrigin of Dance in Indonesia\nIt has been said that before the introduction of formal religion, the gods had powerful influence over the land and people of Indonesia. To induce the gods to answer their prayers, sovereigns proffered fresh flowers and fragrant incense. But the most refined offering is the gift of dance. Indonesian dances can be divided into three broad types: traditional religious dances, dramatised dances, folk and modern dances. Traditional religious dances are based on the belief that the dance would help people make contact with the gods, provide meaning to life or instill a force into things such as crops, fertility or war.\nGambuh is considered the oldest form of dance drama and the source for other dramatic dances. It was performed in the Javanese courts of the Majapahit kingdom and belongs to the semi-sacred or ceremonial group. The stories are usually drawn from the lives of the kings of East Java, very often from the Panji stories. Panji was a prince famed for his search for his beloved Princess Candra Kirana.\nFor about 100 years during Dutch colonial rule, dance lost its importance. After the country gained independence, a desire to express a sense of freedom and democracy prompted the revival of folk and regional dances. Society dances such as the ronggeng of West Java, the handkerchief dance and umbrella dance of the Bugis are primarily for entertainment and have no religious significance. On the other hand, the mask dance is one of the oldest traditions in Indonesian art and exists in almost every region. Many evolved from religious customs and rituals while others are purely for artistic pursuit.\nDances of Java\nYogyakarta and Surakarta, where the kraton (palaces) are located, are famous for the refined and graceful Javanese dances. There are several groups of dances from this region: the Wayang dances originally intended for ritual ceremonies; the sacred Bedojo and Srimpi court dances; the Beksan or War dance; and the dances of the villages.\nThe word ‘wayang’ means shadow. Originally wayang was performed by the head of the family to ask the spirits for guidance for important events like marriage and birth. With family members as witnesses, spirits were said to appear as shadows. Nowadays, current events, rules of behaviour and education form the basis of wayang stories. The different types of wayang include Wayang Kulit (leather puppet) Wayang Klitik (flat wooden puppet), Wayang Golek (wooden puppets) and the non-puppet ones of Wayang Beber (which use paper parchment as a backdrop) and Wayang Wong (human masked dances). The wayang stories are usually based on the Ramayana and Mahabharata epics.\nMain image: Hanuman Indramayu Golek\nStamps: Wayang Golek and Wayang Kulit on stamps\nWayang kulit is a shadow puppet performance and is an integral part of temple festivals. The puppets are made of flat dried buffalo hide. The performance area has a screen and a light (an oil lamp in older days) and in front of the screen sits the Dalang or puppeteer, who conducts and plays the entire wayang. In front of him lie banana tree stems where the puppets are stuck when not in use; bad characters on the left and good ones on the right. At the start and end of the performance, the dalang will place the gunungan in front of the screen. The stage represents life on earth. The dalang symbolises God, the screen is the universe and the banana trunk where the puppets rest is earth. Hinduism first arrived in Indonesia followed closely by Buddhism in the early centuries. The Hindu influence is evident in the shadow puppet stories with themes from the Mahabharata and Ramayana.\nThe Gunungan or Kayon is used to start and end the play, as well as change one scene to another. It represents the Tree of Life and the unity of the cosmic order. Two gatekeepers stand on both sides of the door to the spiritual temple. There are many versions of the gunungan depending on the local culture and social situation. Javanese gunungan have more symbols compared to those from Bali.\nBedojo, began within the walls of the courts of Jogjakarta to mark ceremonies like the sultan’s birthday and special anniversaries. It is performed by girls from the aristocracy. The Bedojo is a slow and deliberate dance performed by nine girls with faces made up like a traditional Javanese bride. On their heads they wear a diadem with a white bird feather. The Srimpi is similar to the Bedojo but less grand and performed by four women. Beksan or War dances are performed by pairs of men and women who retell the stories from some segments of Javanese literature. Away from the courts in the villages, people perform dances such as Ronggeng, Djoged, Handkerchief Dance, Reog and Kuda Lumping, some as courtship dances and others as celebratory dances.\nMain image: The Reog dance;\nStamps (from left): Saucer dance, Kuda Lumping, Fan dance, Reog.\nDances of Bali\nMusic and dance are integral to religious ceremonies and social activity of Balinese life. This island has one of the most intriguing selections of dances. In areas where people practise Buddhism and the Bali-Hindu faith, spirits are often summoned to enter living humans and puppets. This is especially evident in the Sanghyang and Barong dances. The Sanghyang is a trance dance ritual where pre-adolescent girls perform under a hypnotic influence. This dance is performed to ward off disasters or epidemics.\nKecak is probably the most recognisable Balinese dance. With an all-male chorus chanting “cak, cak, cak” in overlapping sequence, the effect is both hypnotic and mystifying. The Kecak is a vocal chant originating from the Sanghyang dance. The Rejang is a sacred dance performed in the inner court of the temple during offerings and celebrations. It is a group dance by pre-adolescent girls, unmarried or older women. They are said to be heavenly maidens who have come to earth.1 The male equivalent is the Baris Gede or warrior dance.\nMain image: Tari paying dancers, courtesy of the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia.\nStamps (clockwise from top left): Wayang Wong, Arsa Wijaya, Kecak, Tambulilingan (bumblebee) dancers, Baris Gede dancer, Cirebon.\nBalinese mask dances have existed for over a century. Like the older types of dances, mask dances were used to drive out evil spirits that could cause havoc to crops. Prayers are said at every step of the mask preparation, from the selection of the tree to the performance. Bali’s Topeng dance-drama often portrays stories based on the lives of the Balinese kings. Early masks have mouthpieces which the actor bites to hold the mask in place. Today, the masks are tied to the face.\nTopeng Pajegan is a monodrama as all the roles are portrayed by one dancer. The stories are usually derived from the chronicles of the kings. Depending on the occasion: wedding, tooth-filing ceremony2 or birth, the performer will choose the story most appropriate for the occasion. The characters appear in a fairly typical sequence. The Patih, a minister of strong character with a red face indicating bravery is first to appear. He is usually followed by a coarse brown face Patih and then a wise old man (Topeng Tua).\nThe last character to appear is Sidhakarya3. After he gives offerings and prayers to the gods he immediately gives chase to the children in the audience. When he catches a child, he carries him to the shrine and holds him up to the gods. The child is then released and rewarded with a small gift of Chinese coins, as a symbol of prosperity. In current times, the Sidhakarya segment does not happen very often.\nThe Topeng Panca is performed by five dancers during temple festivals. The full mask characters such as the king and ministers do not speak but deliver their ideas through elegant and graceful movements. Half-masked characters like the clown servants tell the stories.\nThe Barong is a mythological creature that performs stories that are entwined with black magic and some form of trance. With its big eyes, clacking mouth and furry body, it patrols the village streets clearing away dark forces that bring harm to the land and people. Rangda with her fearful mask is the witch-widow and Queen of Black Magic. She is portrayed with a long hanging tongue, fangs and long hair. In the magical Calonarang dance, the Barong and Rangda characters are pitched against each other in a classic battle between the good and evil.\nThe creation of wayang wong was initiated by Dalem Gede Kusamba, ruler of Klungkung from 1772-1825. He commissioned a new dance based on the Ramayana epic using a collection of royal masks. Following the wayang kulit style, wayang wong was created with human performers instead of puppets. Wayang wong is performed during the holy days of Galungan and Kuningan. As the masks are sacred, they are kept in the temple and are blessed before and after use.\nDances of Sumatra and other Islands\nIn Sumatra, the influence and presence of ancient dances are less evident because the faster paced and social dances are favoured. There are fewer Ramayana and Mahabharata themed dances except around the areas of Batak and South Sumatra. Dances which originated from the worship of the various gods are still performed although the region’s prevailing customary law (adat) and religion now cast an overriding influence.\nVarious dances of Sumatra on stamps.\nDance and the Dragon\nThe huge Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis) lives in a hostile environment with little food and water. It overcame all these challenges and remained fairly untouched by evolution and the Ice Age. The existence of the Komodo dragon is proof of its tenacity.\nThe prehistoric-looking reptile serves as a perfect foil to the refined dance. The reptile’s appearance is beastly, it walks with an awkward gait and displays an amazing instinctive power when it attacks. The dance on the other hand has graceful and refined movements and the technique is acquired through many years of strict training. The Komodo dragon commands respect in its environment and the dance pays reverence to the gods. Although the elegant dance and the awkward Komodo dragon seem worlds apart, there is an interesting link between them. Note the posture of the dancers – the limbs, body, neck and head – with many movements involving raised elbows, and angled torso. Observe the Komodo dragon’s swagger, every step taken with limbs at an angle. Is it pure coincidence or a case of art imitating nature?\nA ‘fire-breathing’ Dragon\nThe fire-breathing dragons as told by ancient mariners who visited the Spice Islands are in reality Komodo Dragons. They are the largest living species of lizard. These venomous lizards can grow to a length of two to three metres weighing about 150 kilograms. Komodo National Park is located at the Lesser Sunda Islands which covers the larger islands of Komodo, Rinca and Pada. Founded in 1980, the national park is also a popular location for scuba diving as the marine biodiversity includes whale sharks, manta rays, pygmy seahorses, sponges and corals.\nKomodo Dragons on stamps.\nNotes", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/land-of-dance-and-dragon-the-diverse-beauty-of-indonesia/story", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/land-of-dance-and-dragon-the-diverse-beauty-of-indonesia/land-of-dance-and-dragon-cover.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:06:04"},

Home to many, including my great-grandmother, this prime location is always alive with chatter whenever my family visits. Text by Ang Zhen Ye\nMuseSG Volume 11 Issue 1 - 2018\nThere is a multi-storey dwelling which is one of the most highly sought-after “residences” in Bishan. Home to many, including my great-grandmother, this prime location is always alive with chatter whenever my family visits. Yet, no one really lives in these blocks of “flats”. Indeed, far from catering to the living, Peck San Theng is a final resting place for the dead.\nThe columbarium in Peck San Theng (Kwong Wai Siew Peck San Theng), which was opened in 1986, is touted as a “condo for the dead”, and can house up to 90,000 occupants.  Still, when compared to the Peck San Theng cemetery of the past, which used to occupy 384 acres, this columbarium is relatively small. My great-grandfather, who passed on decades before his wife and the building of the columbarium, was buried in one of the graves in the cemetery. During the government’s mass grave exhumation in the 1980s, my family had to dig for my great-grandfather’s remains to move him to the new columbarium.1 Unfortunately, my family’s effort to locate his remains proved to be futile. Today, he is forever lost to the ground underneath the tall, modern buildings.\nIncidentally, my family moved to Bishan in 2011 and we are now closer to – or perhaps even living on – the final resting place of my deceased great-grandparents. This daily reality seems to be fundamental to Bishan’s heritage: whether it is inhabitants of Bishan Town or villagers from the former Kampong San Teng, Bishan’s residents have always been living with the dead. How then do residents today live, interact, or even reconcile with the dead? And how has this notion of “living with the dead” evolved from Kampong San Teng to Bishan?\nAn aerial photograph of the Peck San Theng cemetery grounds taken by the British Royal Air Force, 1958. Collection held by the National Archives of Singapore, Crown copyright.\nKampong San Teng – A Town Built around the Dead\nThe name “Bishan” is the pinyinisation of its Chinese counterpart Peck San (碧山), derived from Peck San Theng (碧山亭) Chinese cemetery. Founded in 1870 by three pioneers from Kwong Fu, Wai Chow Fu and Siew Hing Fu prefectures in Canton, China, the cemetery was run by a federation of 16 clans belonging to the Cantonese community in Singapore.2 The cemetery started as a burial ground for the Cantonese, but eventually included other dialect groups and races. As the cemetery expanded over time, it was divided into a series of “hills” and “pavilions”.3\nA motorist map of the Peck San Them cemetery, with the red-circled numbers indicating the pavilions, undated. Image courtesy of Kwong Wai Siew Peck San Theng.\nTo locate a particular grave, one must first find the “hill” or the “pavilion” number – for example Wong Fook Hill, Pavilion No. 5 (黄福山, 第五亭) – before navigating through the thick undergrowth within the section to find the grave. This gave rise to the name “Peck San Theng”, which means “Pavilions on the Jade Hills”.\nWong Fook Hill, Pavilion No 5, undated. Image courtesy of Kwong Wai Siew Peck San Theng.\nFollowing the establishment of Peck San Theng, people began to settle around the burial grounds. At first, the small community consisted of cemetery caretakers, gravediggers, peddlers selling ritual-related goods and others in charge of honouring the dead. Later on, with the influx of Chinese immigrants during the early 20th century, the community bloomed into a kampong known as Kampong San Teng.4 However, even with the rise of new landmarks – a Chinese school, traditional teahouse, wet market, and an open-air cinema, the highlight of village life still revolved around the annual festivals for the dead, including Double Ninth Festival (重阳节), Qing Ming Festival (清明节) and the Hungry Ghost Festival (中元节).5\nA crowd outside Kwong Wai Siew Peck San Theng during the Qing Ming Festival, 1988. Image courtesy of Kwong Wai Siew Peck San Theng.\nBe it cutting the grass to find the graves, preparing food in the teahouse or setting up theatrical performances or rites, the entire community would engage and interact with the dead during these three festivals. While most would have heard about the Qing Ming and Hungry Ghost festivals, not many people today know about the Taoist Double Ninth Festival. The Double Ninth Festival is held on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month. During this festival, people would carry a dogwood plant, climb the hills, drink chrysanthemum wine, and eat chong yang (重阳) cake.6 Many believed that the higher one climbed, the more successful one would be.7 In addition, Kampong San Teng would also organise theatrical performances (getai), lion dances, and sacrifices and offerings for the spirits. Even secret societies would participate in this festival. However, instead of commemorating Huan Jing, a mythological hero who defeated an evil monster, the local gangs would choose to worship a martyr who died while engaging in secret society activities. For smaller gangs without such martyrs, they would worship a deity called Ah Phoh San (阿婆神).8\nActivities that were associated with the dead did not only happen during these festivals. Being next to the cemetery, villagers interacted with the departed on a daily basis – often in various interesting and surprising ways. Children, for instance, played hide-and-seek in the cemetery without fear. Even when they fell into open graves, some would take the opportunity to “fish” from the graves! Loh Soo Har, a former villager and teacher at Peck San Theng Chinese School recounts:\nAs the village area was surrounded by trees, it was not so suitable to fly kites there, so we would go on top of the hills... Sometimes, when we accidentally broke the string of the kite, and had to chase after the body of the kite, we would fall into [empty] graves. Sometimes, we would discover fish in the graves. Usually, people would put a water tank beside the coffin. Strangely, catfish started growing inside, and I even caught a few myself. At that time, we even sold them for money! You could say that we took the cemetery as a playground!\nHowever, it was not as if there was no fear of the supernatural. Ng Su Chan, a former villager, recounts that his friend “walked into a ghost (and had) a high fever... for seven days, but miraculously after seven days, he recovered”.9 Such stories of other worldly beings and mysterious ailments were common and almost every villager had a personal story to tell.\nSecret societies, on the contrary, did not fear the cemetery. Rather, local gangs enjoyed a cordial relationship with the dead, resulting in much lawlessness in the area. The origins of this lawlessness can be traced back to Toa Payoh in the 1950s and 60s.\nToa Payoh then was popularly known as the “Chicago of Singapore” or the mafia district of Singapore. Much of these gangster activities spilled over to Kampong San Teng, which was considered an extension of Toa Payoh. Furthermore, the quiet and secluded nature of the cemetery made it ideal for secret societies such as Flying Dragon (飞龙) and Harmony Peace (和平) to carry out gangster activities there.10 This is illustrated in several incidences in the 1950s. On 25 June 1950, two men were caught with over one ton of unpaid-duties tobacco. In an attempt to arrest illegal distillers, the customs police, on 20 November 1954, faced off with a “menacing mob of 60 men armed with sticks”. The mob surrounded the police, allowing the criminals to escape in the scuffle.\nThe entrance of Kampong San Teng, facing Upper Thomson Road, 1958. Image courtesy of Kwong Wai Siew Peck San Theng.\nDue to its reputation for housing many secret societies, Kampong San Teng also became the logical place to investigate criminal activities, such as the kidnapping of multi-millionaire Tan Lark Sye’s nephew in 1957. These secret societies were also hostile to one another. Armed with parangs and guns, they often clashed with each other on the hills. The police were understandably hesitant to enter the cemetery and rarely patrolled the area, not to mention taxi drivers who avoided the place altogether. Peck San Theng cemetery, in one of the administrator’s words, was truly “messy and lawless”.\nSeeking Refuge among the Dead\nOn 13 February 1942, during the Second World War, a critical battle between the British and the Japanese took place on the cemetery grounds. On one side was the 2nd Battalion of the Cambridgeshire Regiment, 5th Royal Norfolk Regiment, 5th Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiments, and on the other, the lead elements of the Japanese Imperial Guards. The first engagement was a surprise hit-and-run bayonet attack at 11.30pm. Shortly after, the fighting intensified and both sides suffered heavy losses. Still, the 2nd Cambridgeshire Regiment managed to hold their position on knoll No. 90 (located somewhere between Pavilion No. 1 and 3). The final orders came on 15 February at 3.30pm: a half-hour ceasefire. Approximately two hours later, General Percival officially surrendered to the Japanese.11\nDuring the start of the Japanese invasion, especially after the bombing of Chinatown, many Chinese – most famously the Samsui women – moved to seek refuge among the tombs.12Their belief that Peck San Theng would be safer was unfortunately false. Not only did a fierce battle take place in Peck San Theng, the kampong was also bombed by the Japanese. Lim Choo Sye recounts:\nIt was the first time I had... such an experience of seeing how much damage bombs could do to a village... full of attap houses... it was an experience one can never forget, having seen so many houses flattened. A few people died, killed by the blasts, not so much by the bombing. There were a few limbs hanging on trees and all the trees had no more leaves.\nNevertheless, while the kampong cemetery was ravaged during the Japanese invasion, life during the occupation itself was rather peaceful. Compared to the urban city areas, the Japanese left the kampong cemetery relatively untouched. The place was spared due to a few possible reasons: the Japanese fears of offending the dead, the importance of the village as a food producer, and the perception that the rural Chinese were less dangerous than their urban counterparts. Those who sought refuge among the dead recalled that they were never called up for forced labour or screenings (Sook Ching operations) and lived a safe life in Kampong San Teng.13\nFrom Peck San to Bishan\nIn September 1973, the government issued an order to stop all fresh burials and closed the cemetery. Six years later, Peck San Theng’s land was officially acquired for urban development. The notice for exhumation was given in November 1979 and from 1983 to 1990, Peck San was redeveloped into Bishan Town.\nFamily members praying to their ancestors prior to the exhumation of graves at Peck San cemetery, 1980s. Ronni Pinsler Collection, image courtesy of National Archives of Singapore.\nKampong San Teng and its residents were also resettled to other new towns, with most moving to Ang Mo Kio.14 With the dead now occupying a much smaller space at the columbarium, how did modern residents go about living, interacting, or reconciling with the dead at the margins of the town? The answer seems to lie in both the architecture and the urban myths of the town.\nPeck San Theng may be physically gone, but its pavilions live on in the architecture of Bishan’s Housing & Development Board (HDB) flats. These iconic pavilion-inspired HDB roofs were popularised by Singapore’s sitcom series Under One Roof in the 1990s. More than a simple reminder about Bishan’s ghostly past, Under One Roof romanticised the ideal Singaporean life: living in a prime location 5-room HDB at with children who were well educated – a marked departure from the taboo of living with the dead.\nUrban myths about Bishan are yet another form of interaction with the dead. Just as how ghost stories were rife in Kampong San Teng, new residents of Bishan Town had their own supernatural experiences to share. These myths persisted and were even published in The Straits Times in an article titled “Is Bishan MRT ‘unclean’?”  \nIt is late at night and you are on the last train... The train, which is bound for Kranji, pulls into Bishan MRT station and you prepare to alight. To your astonishment, it does not stop. Furious, you confront the driver and demand to know why. He asks you how many passengers you saw waiting on the platform. 10 to 15, you say. He replies: “I saw more than 50 people and some were without faces. That’s why I didn’t stop.”\nEven today, Bishan station is considered one of the most haunted places in Singapore. There are many different stories of faceless, headless, or other worldly beings terrorising the station at night, all fuelled by the fact that the station does sit over former graves.15 Conversely, many also consider Bishan to be a place with good fengshui.16  As Kenneth Pinto puts it,\nWhen the place started getting more popular with people because it was quite central, then things got twisted around... Because of the cemetery’s high ground, you got good views, supposedly good fengshui. And, yeah, conveniently forget all these ghost stories.17\nConcluding Thoughts: The Dead as a Reflection of the Living\nIn many ways, the legacy of the dead is reflected in the lives of the living. Just as how the dead moved from jade hills to “condos”, the living too moved from kampongs to high-rise flats. What is currently home to some 90,000 Singaporeans was once an idyllic resting place for more than 100,000 Chinese migrants. Yet, in this process of turning squatters to citizens, many former kampong residents feel a sense of longing for the past; a sense that they have lost a familiar way of life, relationships, and people, in exchange for modernity and a new way of life.18 That is not to say that the choice to develop was wrong.\nAn aerial view of Bishan Town, 2018. Image courtesy of National Heritage Board.\nWithout having moved the graves, I wouldn't be able to live in Bishan and enjoy its modern facilities. But there is something nostalgic - even for a new resident like me - to be so closely associated with the dead. This nostalgia cannot be substituted by pavilion roofs or urban myths. Perhaps the best way to reconcile with the past to remember its history: just as how I remember the elusive great-grandparents that I \"live\" with today\nFurther Reading\n1.

From the world-famous chicken rice to the late night roti prata, the crowd-favourite laksa to the comforting flavours of nasi lemak, Singapore’s hawkers have been feeding generations of people from all walks of life. Hawker food plays a much greater role than just filling our bellies – it is a legacy that unites all Singaporeans.\nFrom Boon Lay to Maxwell and to Bedok, hawker centres have become the nation’s community dining rooms, where the office worker takes his usual morning breakfast perhaps in a hurry, while the retired senior digs into a bowl of noodles at his own leisure. Neighbours meet up regularly to catch up on news and gossip, parents dart from stall to stall to bring home their children’s favourite dishes, and grandparents reminisce about the good old days over a cup of freshly brewed coffee. It all happens right here.\nSo where did our Hawker Culture come from? What does it represent for Singaporeans? To really understand the Singaporeans’ love story with hawker food, we will have to journey right to the beginning, when our ancestors brought the very first hawker dishes from their homeland.\nHistory of Hawker Culture\n1800s – The Origins\nSingapore in the 1800s was a thriving port city which attracted migrants from China, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, and other lands, seeking a better life. They were hard labourers, merchants, clerks, and cooks who brought with them the comfort food they grew up with. They adapted these dishes to ingredients that were easily available here, and cooked them using local techniques, eventually creating a recognisable Singapore flavour.\nMany immigrants saw street hawking as a good way to earn a living, as it required little capital. These early pioneers started to ply the streets, serving the dishes that they were most familiar with. The streets were bustling with activity, colours, aromas, and flavours. Chinese hawkers would carry their mobile kitchens around, balanced on a bamboo pole along with their ingredients and utensils, so they could serve up piping hot meals on the go. Malay hawkers typically sold fruits and flame grilled meat sticks, a dish that we would come to know as satay. Indian hawkers added colourful sweets, cakes, and jellies to the street scene. One could even see a hawker walking his cow or goat on the street, ready to “dispense” fresh milk whenever a customer demanded.\nMalay hawker with his portable shop selling satay. (1907. Photo courtesy of National Archives of Singapore.)\nWith just three cents, anyone could afford a sumptuous meal of three to four dishes, served up at a moment’s notice. On the same street, one could easily savour the flavours from different parts of Asia, catered to local tastes. This vibrant beginning marked the first chapters of Singapore’s hawker story.\nUp to 1960s – A need for regulation\nAfter the Second World War, many who were unemployed turned to hawking as a profession, and that was when the street hawker scene became a thriving world of possibilities.\nA street side hawker, possibly selling pork innards soup and/or bak kut teh. Diners sit on wooden stools around the stall facing the hawker who would take their orders and serve the food hot from the pot. Hawkers usually wear cotton shorts or pants with white cotton sleeved tee shirts to keep themselves cool and comfortable. (1965. Photo courtesy of National Archives of Singapore.)\nHowever, not everyone shared the optimistic view of Singapore’s street hawker scene. In 1950, Governor F. Gimson set up the Hawkers Inquiry Commission and in the Hawkers Inquiry Report, it was stated that “There is undeniably a disposition among officials ... to regard the hawkers as primarily a public nuisance to be removed from the streets.”\nThe hawkers in Singapore during that time usually did not have easy access to water. This made it difficult to keep their utensils clean and prevent contamination by flies and rats. Without a properly assigned disposal area, hawkers often left piles of refuse on the streets, posing a threat to public health and hygiene. Many who were selling cold drinks, cut fruits, and ice cream used water and ice that might be easily contaminated, potentially causing outbreaks of cholera and typhoid.\nAnother issue the government faced was the challenge in street cleaning as the entire physical space where the hawkers plied their trade was viewed as a disorderly obstruction to traffic and city planning. As such, the colonial government started looking for ways to regulate the hawkers and relocate them.\nLate 1960s to 1980s – The first hawker centres\nAfter Singapore’s independence in 1965, along with the move to turn Singapore into the region’s business hub, the work of licensing hawkers and relocating them into more organised spaces picked up momentum. In 1968 and 1969, the government conducted an islandwide registration of street hawkers, issuing temporary licenses and moving them into back lanes, car parks, and vacant plots of land.\nStreet hawkers at Trengganu Street. After the 1980s, street hawkers no longer plied the streets as permanent hawker centres were set up. (1971. Photo courtesy of National Archives of Singapore.)\nDespite this move, illegal hawking remained rampant. In 1974, the Hawker’s Department Special Squad was formed to handle the situation. Public Health Inspectors, who were responsible for keeping illegal hawkers off the streets, were given handsets similar to those used by the police and could use them to relay information and seek backup assistance while CISCO officers escorted them on the ground. These new measures proved especially effective against the illegal pasar malam (night markets) that sprung up across the city.\nEnforcement was not all bad news. From 1971 to 1986, the government sought to relocate up to 18,000 hawkers to markets and hawker centres with proper amenities, so hawkers could have a safe and hygienic place to work without having to run from the inspectors.\nThe Housing Development Board (HDB) was responsible for the meticulous planning of every hawker centre to make sure that they were in well-populated areas. Each hawker centre was built within walking distance for most residents of the HDB estate, or a short bus ride away, while not being too close to one another. Chomp Chomp Food Centre, Block 51 Old Airport Road, and Tiong Bahru Market were among the first hawker centres to serve up mouth-watering Singaporean delicacies in this exciting new era of the hawker story.\nBalloting of market stalls at the old Kallang Airport estate. (1963. Photo courtesy of National Archives of Singapore.)\n1980s to present – Building a legacy\nThe five-year span between 1974 to 1979 saw 54 hawker centres built to serve residents and workers across the nation. Different architectural and design themes gave each hawker centre their unique touch. Newton Hawker Centre, for example, was built in 1971 with the idea of having “hawker stalls in a garden setting” with trees for shade, hedges and shrubs alongside a car park and a public toilet. The last food centre to be erected during this phase was Block 505 Market and Food Centre at Jurong West Street 52, in 1986.\nNewton Food Centre in the 1980s. (Photo courtesy of National Archives of Singapore.)\nToday, more than 110 hawker centres are located across Singapore, and there are plans to construct even more to better cater to our population (data extracted from the website of the National Environment Agency).\n“Hawker centres represent the culinary soul of Singapore, where everyone regardless of race and social background gathers for their daily meals. I grew up having meals at hawker centres and hope that my daughter gets to enjoy the same culinary experience as I do.”\nHugo Bart, frequent patron at hawker centres\nEven our hawkers have chosen to continue their family’s legacy by carrying on the trade that their parents or grandparents had started. More than half of today’s hawkers are second and third generation hawkers, most of them specialising in a particular dish, refining the recipes that have been passed down to them, and sometimes adding adventurous twists to their flavours.\n\nHaron Satay & Chicken Wing has come a long way from being razed by a fire in 2013 to the passing of their founder in 2016. Regulars nicknamed the satay as bakar-ed satay Haron as a tribute to the late Mr Haron Abu Bakar who founded the Satay in 1978. (2018. Photo courtesy of National Heritage Board.)\n“My customers are like my close friends; I can even say some are like extended family. As a hawker, I don’t just sell the food, I share the culture and heritage to my fellow Singaporeans.”\nMdm Muthuletchmi, Hawker at Ghim Moh Market & Food Centre\nGearing up for the Future\nThe Hawker Centres Upgrading Program (HUP) was launched in February 2001 to improve the dining experience at hawker centres, both for the hardworking hawkers and the patrons. Upgraded hawker centres enjoy re-tiling, new tables and seats, replacement of utility services, rewiring, improvement to the ventilation, bin centres and toilets, re-roofing where necessary, and provision of exhaust flue systems. Some centres even go through a complete reconfiguration or rebuilding. In addition to central freezer areas, central wash areas are also set up for sorting out used crockery. While the space is not air-conditioned to keep operating costs down and to preserve the traditional atmosphere and charm of hawker centres, barrier-free access has been prioritised to facilitate the movement of patrons in wheelchairs.\nThis is the Old Kallang Airport Hawker Centre which replaced the previous wet market in 1971. All stalls at this food centre are let out on rental basis and priority is given to residents of Old Kallang Airport Estate. Behind the row of stalls is the Mobil petrol station on Old Airport Road. (1983. Photo courtesy of National Archives of Singapore.)\nIn 2019, the government announced that 13 new hawker centres will be built by the year 2027. This new chapter would inject new energy into Singapore’s Hawker Culture, combined with the latest technologies in automation and sustainability, while preserving the heritage and authenticity of our hawker centres. The new hawker centre in Bukit Panjang, for example, is built with a trellis at its roof garden to allow for the installation of solar panels. Other sustainable features include a pneumatic waste conveyance system that will transport waste automatically to a central station through a network of pipes, so that cleaning would be more efficient and effective.\nBukit Panjang Hawker Centre features eco-friendly designs such as high roof ceilings for better ventilation, an open dining area to maximise natural lighting, and wide usage of louvres to utilise natural light while giving shade. It also introduces a green wall to promote a more sustainable ecosystem in the neighbourhood. (2020. Photo courtesy of National Heritage Board.)\nHonouring our Hawker Culture\nThe story of our Hawker Culture would never have been written if not for the passion of hawkers, and the support of community groups, the government, and food-loving Singaporeans. The rich culinary offerings of our hawker centres represent the Chinese, Malay, Indian, and other communities that call this country home. In recent years, international cuisine has also made its way into the heartlanders’ bellies. Patrons today can enjoy fish and chips, Japanese udon sets, Hong Kong dim sum, and even Korean kimchi at their favourite hawker centres.\n“Our family is always looking into new ways to excite our customers without losing the touch of our traditional roots. It’s not just food; we are serving a legacy.”\nAfiq Rezza bin Norrezat, Hawker at Ang Mo Kio Market & Food Centre\nSafeguarding Singapore’s Hawker Culture\nThere are four pillars to the safeguarding of Singapore’s Hawker Culture – Transmission, Research and Documentation, Support and Promotion. These are demonstrated through the collaborative efforts among government agencies, hawkers, training institutions, community organisations, academia, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and individuals.\nTransmission\nHawkers are encouraged to pass down their culinary practices to apprentices or family members. This is demonstrated through initiatives such as the Hawkers’ Development Programme, introduced by the National Environment Agency and Skills Future Singapore to teach aspiring hawkers about the culinary secrets of experienced hawkers, and to provide apprenticeships, to ensure that our hawker favourites will continue to be served for generations to come.\nComprising three stages (training, apprenticeship, running an incubation stall), the Hawkers’ Development Programme aims to equip both existing and aspiring hawkers with the relevant skills and competencies to run their businesses at #OurHawkerCentres. (2020. Photo courtesy of National Environment Agency.)\nResearch and documentation\nLocal food advocates and community organisations have been actively documenting the country’s rich hawker heritage and recipes of local delights. This culture has even piqued the interests of academics and experts. This rich library of publications, editorials, and multimedia materials continue to grow, providing the public with a comprehensive resource pool to further enrich their love for local food.\nSupport\nOrganisations such as the Federation of Merchants’ Associations, Singapore (FMAS), as well as other hawkers’ associations and representatives, work closely with the government to provide support and additional resources for our hawkers. The National Environmental Agency (NEA) has also set up an Incubation Stall Programme to encourage aspiring hawkers to set up their stalls with a lower start-up cost and pre-fitted basic equipment. Together, these organisations have also organised the Hawkers’ Seminar to encourage hawkers to come together to exchange ideas and strengthen the survivability of the culture.\nMs Chong Chiew Fung decided to give up her job as a quantity surveyor to venture into the hawker trade through the NEA’S Incubation Stall Programme. (2020. Photo courtesy of National Environment Agency.)\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic hit, support schemes, grants and courses on digital solutions were offered to help hawkers tide through the difficult period.\nPromotion\nHeritage and food enthusiasts, as well as museums and other organisations have launched exhibitions and campaigns to help promote Singapore’s Hawker Culture. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs), such as Slow Food Singapore, have also been organising different workshops and programmes to educate students and the wider community about our food heritage, while private entities like Eat.Shop.Play have tapped on digital and social media to promote hawker stalls in Singapore.\nKueh Appreciation Day hosted by Slow Food Singapore to build awareness and deepen appreciation of our local kueh and kueh producers who continue to produce these local delights by hand according to traditional recipes and techniques. (2016.

The inscription reflected our Hawker Culture’s significance in Singaporeans’ multicultural identity as a people, and as a nation, and affirms our commitment to safeguard it for future generations.\nFrom hawker plates to global palates\nSo, what does it mean for Singaporeans for our hawker culture to be inscribed as the UNESCO Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity? For the nation, it confirms our international standing as a culinary destination on the world map. For our hawkers, this is a recognition that their years of hard work have shaped Singapore’s culture for entire generations. For our food lovers, it is a testament of our passionate late-night visits to Chomp Chomp and our weekend trips across the island just to enjoy a bowl of laksa – a culinary love story that is forever written in history.\nHawker Culture in Singapore will continue into the future, so that our future generations can continue to enjoy the food passed down from our ancestors. (2018. Photo Courtesy of National Heritage Board.)\nFor generations to come, every Singaporean will continue to enjoy the traditional flavours from their heritage and various ethnic groups. Each bowl of soup, each plate of rice, and each cup of coffee – made with two centuries of passion and pride through the hard work and creativity of hawkers who adapted to the changing times and needs of communities.\nNotes", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/Serving-Up-a-Legacy", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/Hawker-Culture/NHB_HC_Roots-Page-Banner.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:06:07"},

One key reason for this significance is that fig trees provide food for a great number of other animals in the forest. One research study has found that over 1,270 species of mammals and birds, as well as a number of reptiles and fish, feed on figs to varying degrees (Shanahan et al. 2001). In addition, many other tropical rainforest trees are seasonal, producing fruit only in certain months or even certain years, whereas figs bear fruit all-year round, thus providing reliable and nutritious source of food for forest-dwelling birds and other beasts.\nA fruit with a long history\nWild figs have existed for millions of years but their use in agriculture by our ancestors appears to have originated as far back as 11,400 years ago in the Near East. This was established in 2006 by archaeologists from Israel and the United States who found the remnants of dried figs at an archaeological site in the Jordan Valley (Kislev et al. 2006). Their discovery, which was published in the journal Science, suggests that figs were being used in agriculture even before olives and grapes, making them the oldest cultivated fruits to date\nMost figs that are cultivated by mankind are varieties of a single species, Ficus carica, also known as the Common Fig. The name carica comes from Caria, a region in Asia Minor that is now part of Turkey. Turkey is the world’s large producer of figs, accounting for approximately 27% of the total production of figs, followed by Egypt, then the USA. In Asia, figs are cultivated in Japan and China, but these are mostly retained for the domestic market. The cultivation of figs and the recognition of their nutritious quality have helped spread the fig far and wide. Today, figs are found wherever the weather permits and are cultivated in regions outside their native range like France and California\nThis Malayan Banyan or Jejawi tree (Ficus microcarpa) is a prominent landmark at Kallang Riverside Park. These trees are often left undisturbed by locals and often have shrines set up under their canopy. Photo by Marcus Ng.\nTrees that depend on tiny wasps\nDespite their widespread cultivation and popularity as culinary treats, few people are aware that aside from Ficus carica, there are more than 700 species of figs worldwide. Approximately 500 species can be found in Australasia, making this region the most diverse for figs. Some of the most well-known local trees are figs; readers are surely familiar with Banyans or Strangler Figs (Ficus benjamina or Ficus microcarpa), which begin life as tiny seeds deposited on the branch of another, already mature, tree by a passing bird. The fig sapling then sprouts and sends down roots towards the ground. These aerial roots, which confer a rather spooky atmosphere to these figs, later thicken and ‘strangle’ the host tree, which dies off. The Banyan that remains forms a thick canopy with a dense latticework of roots, which provide ample habitat for other plants and animals. In the ruins of the Angkor Wat complex in Cambodia, large strangler figs have taken over some temple compounds, their roots enveloping the ancient stone walls and gopurams with a layer of living wood.\nAnother little-known fact about figs is that these magnificent, life-giving trees are completely dependent on tiny wasps measuring just a few millimetres in length, which are the only insects able to successfully pollinate their flowers. These fig wasps are very different from the hornets and other social wasps that visit flowers in parks and gardens and nest in elaborate hives; fig wasps do not feed as adults, lack stings and are totally harmless to humans; in fact, without fig wasps, we would have no figs at all.\nFigs and fig wasps share what is known to ecologists as a reciprocal obligate mutualism. This means that both partners cannot reproduce without the other. The relationship is made more complex by the fact that approximately two-thirds of all fig species have a one-to-one relationship whereby each species of fig tree can only be pollinated by a single species of fig wasp. Thus, the extinction of the pollinator would mean the extinction of its associated fig tree as well.\nThe Chinese refer to figs as ‘Wu hua guo’ or ‘flowerless fruit’, a name which aptly describes the distinctive reproductive features of figs. Instead of showy flowers that bloom in the open from the tips of branches, figs produce an enclosed receptacle that is full of hundreds of tiny individual florets. This receptacle, called the syconium, is often thought to be the fruit, but it is not a fruit until pollination has taken place.\nAt the bottom of this receptacle, keen observers will see a tiny entrance called the ostiole. This hole serves to allow the female fig wasp to enter the syconium. She then proceeds to simultaneously pollinate the fig and lay her eggs. Her offspring, when they finally emerge as adults, will then mate with each other within the syconium. The male wasps die after mating, but the mated female will exit the syconium via the ostiole, carrying pollen on her body as she flies off to find other figs of the same species. When she reaches and enters a new syconium, the pollen on her body fertilises the fig and the life-cycles of both tree and wasp are repeated. In the meantime, the pollinated florets in the syconium will ripen and turn the receptacle into a delectable fruit enjoyed by humans and frugivorous animals. In short, the fig tree provides a nest for the offspring of the fig wasp, and in return the fig wasp pollinates the flowers of the fig. It is a mutualism that has lasted over 60 millions years and ensured the survival of both groups of organisms.\nCut into half, the Golden Hairy Fig (Ficus aurata) shows a fig wasp making its way around the florets in the syconium. As the fig wasp wanders inside the fig, she picks up pollen which will pollinate other figs she visits. Photo by author.\nThese tiny wasps with long ovipositors (Philotrypesis sp.) are not pollinators but parasitic wasps whose young outcompete the larvae of pollinating fig wasps. Photo by author.\nIn Singapore, figs are the second large genus of woody plants with 48 recorded native species, of which 32 (66%) are considered critically endangered or nationally extinct (Chong et al. 2009). This is largely the result of deforestation, which has replaced nearly all of the island’s original vegetation with urban spaces that support only a handful of hardy fig species such as Banyans. Another, more pervasive, threat to the survival of all species of figs is the possibility that their tiny pollinators will go extinct. A study carried out by my colleagues and myself using four species of fig wasps found in Singapore suggests that climate warming may not bode well for the short-lived tiny pollinators, as the projected increases in temperature expected for the tropics may shorten the lifespan of fig wasps by 33-60%. (Jevanandam et al. 2013). For an insect that already has a brief adult lifespan of just 1-2 days, this means a drastic reduction in the time it has to mate, locate a suitable fig, lay eggs and pollinate the florets. Over time, the reduction or absence of pollination services would lead to fewer ripe figs, and in turn both urban and wild animals may be adversely affected as they would lose a valuable source of food.\nFigs in culture and cultivation\nUnlike animals in the wild, people are luckier since most of the appetising figs that end up in our stores and on our plates are parthenocarpic, which means that the fig ripens on its own without pollination. Most of the figs commercially cultivated in California are of this type, while those in the Middle East are a combination of wasp-pollinated and parthenocarpic cultivars.\nDue to their sweetness, nutritious value and abundant crops, figs play an important role as a food resource in many cultures around the world. Dried figs are an excellent source of minerals, vitamins and anti-oxidants. In fact, dried fruits are concentrated sources of energy, with each 100 grams of dried figs providing approximately 249 calories. Fresh figs, on the other hand, contain antioxidants such as vitamins A, E, and K. Both dried and fresh figs have a high calcium content and rank second after oranges in terms of calcium content in fruits.\nEven today, figs continue to play an important role in food and nutrition. This is most evident during the month of Ramadan when Muslims from around the world including Singapore break their daily fast with a combination of figs, honey, dates, olives and bread.\nIn traditional Chinese medicine, dried figs are used as an ingredient in tonics to help strengthen the lungs and relieve coughs. In Western cuisine, dried figs are popular as healthy, energy-rich snacks like the fig newton, which is a widely consumed pastry roll filled with fig paste. Figs are also made into jams, preserves, biscuits and confections such as Turkish baklava. The dried leaves of one native fig, Ficus auriculata, can be used to make a medicinal tea\nThe fig’s significance does not just end with it being an easy-to-consume, nutritious food. These trees also have a strong religious significance in the East. It is said that Buddha found enlightenment while meditating under a Bodhi Tree, which is believed to be Ficus religiosa, a fig native to India but which has been introduced to Singapore. And so throughout countries where Buddhism prevails, like India, Thailand, Sri Lanka and Singapore, figs are revered and often planted as a religious symbol and worshiped in the absence of proper temples. When I was travelling in Thailand, a number of restaurants I dined at had a pressed leaf of Ficus religiosa on the first page of their menus, an indication of the deep-seated religious significance the fig tree holds in Thai culture.\nFig trees such as the Bodhi Tree play a prominent role in many world religions and cultures. In Singapore, they are often planted in the grounds of Buddhist and Hindu temples. Photo by Marcus Ng.\nRecalling Buddha's moment of enlightenment, this Bodhi Tree (Ficus Religiosa) at a Burmese Temple at Tai Gin Road had a statue of Buddha and shrine by its trunk. Photo by Marcus Ng.\nBut the bold, ubiquitous fig doesn’t hold back and has ventured beyond Islam and Buddhism into Christianity. It has been argued by some scholars that the forbidden fruit, which Adam and Eve consumed in the Garden of Eden, was the fig and not the apple. And that the leaves of the fig were used to cover Adam and Eve when they realised that they were naked. The most famous depiction of the fig as the forbidden fruit was painted by the Italian artist Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475-1564) in his masterpiece fresco on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City.\nFigs in various forms\nNot all figs grow to become massive trees like the Banyan or Bodhi. Figs exhibit different growth forms that include climbers, shrubs, average-sized trees and large trees which reach well above the canopy. Many of these forms are found in Singapore. One large native fig tree is the Common Red Stem Fig (Ficus variegata), which can grow up to 40 metres high and is found mainly in parks and nature reserves. There is one specimen in the Botanic Gardens growing near the visitor centre, which can be recognised by the bright red figs growing in clusters from the trunk. Another native fig species, Ficus punctata, is a woody climber that can be found extensively along Holland Road on the side of Botanic Gardens. This species is easy to spot when it is figging as the figs look like oranges. A very common roadside shrub is the White-leaved Fig (Ficus grossu-larioides) which often attracts bulbuls, green pigeons, black-naped orioles and Asian koels among other birds. These species and more dot our urban landscape and provide sustenance for our urban fauna. As a result, the possible loss or reduced abundance of figs from the landscape should be of major conservation concern. Their value in our concrete jungle is perhaps most appreciated by local bird watchers and photographers who often flock to figging trees in anticipation of the huge variety of birds that visit these trees to feed.\nOriental Pied Hornbills (Anthracoceros albirostris) have recently made a comeback in Singapore. They can be seen at Pulau Ubin and Changi, where they feed on fruit such as figs. Photo by Ron Yeo.\nPink-necked green pigeons are among the many native birds that feed on figs. Photo by Ron Yeo.\nSome of the figs found in Singapore are 120 to 160 years old as of 2013. Fortunately, the National Parks Board’s Heritage Tree Scheme, which began in 2001, identifies and conserves mature trees that are rare and have historical significance. There were 199 trees on the list in 2013, of which 34 were figs consisting of eight species. In particular, a 120-year old heritage fig tree at Sentosa Island was made a star when it received much media attention after being featured in a 2001 film, The Tree, starring popular local actress Zoe Tay.\nAnd so it is, food, faith and controversy define the fig’s story, making it a ‘keystone’ in more ways than one. Like the roots of its own great Banyans, the magnificent Ficus in all its forms and habits has firmly intertwined itself into the lives of both people and wildlife. Given that more than half our 48 native species are endangered or extinct, no effort should be spared in conserving them. The next time you walk past a fig, take a moment to stop, observe the many birds, monkeys and squirrels that feast on its fruit, and appreciate how this natural bounty is the result of a complex yet fragile relationship with a tiny wasp that not many people have heard of and few have seen.\nThe Fabulous Figs of Singapore, which inspired this article’s title, is an excellent pocket book written by local fig enthusiasts. It provides a list of fig species found in Singapore with pictures, helpful descriptions and locations of notable trees. Available at good book stores, this is an informative little book I used when I first started out on my journey into the world of figs.\nDr. Nanthinee Jevanandam did her PhD research in figs at the National University of Singapore.

Home to many, including my great-grandmother, this prime location is always alive with chatter whenever my family visits. Text by Ang Zhen Ye\nMuseSG Volume 11 Issue 1 - 2018\nThere is a multi-storey dwelling which is one of the most highly sought-after “residences” in Bishan. Home to many, including my great-grandmother, this prime location is always alive with chatter whenever my family visits. Yet, no one really lives in these blocks of “flats”. Indeed, far from catering to the living, Peck San Theng is a final resting place for the dead.\nThe columbarium in Peck San Theng (Kwong Wai Siew Peck San Theng), which was opened in 1986, is touted as a “condo for the dead”, and can house up to 90,000 occupants.  Still, when compared to the Peck San Theng cemetery of the past, which used to occupy 384 acres, this columbarium is relatively small. My great-grandfather, who passed on decades before his wife and the building of the columbarium, was buried in one of the graves in the cemetery. During the government’s mass grave exhumation in the 1980s, my family had to dig for my great-grandfather’s remains to move him to the new columbarium.1 Unfortunately, my family’s effort to locate his remains proved to be futile. Today, he is forever lost to the ground underneath the tall, modern buildings.\nIncidentally, my family moved to Bishan in 2011 and we are now closer to – or perhaps even living on – the final resting place of my deceased great-grandparents. This daily reality seems to be fundamental to Bishan’s heritage: whether it is inhabitants of Bishan Town or villagers from the former Kampong San Teng, Bishan’s residents have always been living with the dead. How then do residents today live, interact, or even reconcile with the dead? And how has this notion of “living with the dead” evolved from Kampong San Teng to Bishan?\nAn aerial photograph of the Peck San Theng cemetery grounds taken by the British Royal Air Force, 1958. Collection held by the National Archives of Singapore, Crown copyright.\nKampong San Teng – A Town Built around the Dead\nThe name “Bishan” is the pinyinisation of its Chinese counterpart Peck San (碧山), derived from Peck San Theng (碧山亭) Chinese cemetery. Founded in 1870 by three pioneers from Kwong Fu, Wai Chow Fu and Siew Hing Fu prefectures in Canton, China, the cemetery was run by a federation of 16 clans belonging to the Cantonese community in Singapore.2 The cemetery started as a burial ground for the Cantonese, but eventually included other dialect groups and races. As the cemetery expanded over time, it was divided into a series of “hills” and “pavilions”.3\nA motorist map of the Peck San Them cemetery, with the red-circled numbers indicating the pavilions, undated. Image courtesy of Kwong Wai Siew Peck San Theng.\nTo locate a particular grave, one must first find the “hill” or the “pavilion” number – for example Wong Fook Hill, Pavilion No. 5 (黄福山, 第五亭) – before navigating through the thick undergrowth within the section to find the grave. This gave rise to the name “Peck San Theng”, which means “Pavilions on the Jade Hills”.\nWong Fook Hill, Pavilion No 5, undated. Image courtesy of Kwong Wai Siew Peck San Theng.\nFollowing the establishment of Peck San Theng, people began to settle around the burial grounds. At first, the small community consisted of cemetery caretakers, gravediggers, peddlers selling ritual-related goods and others in charge of honouring the dead. Later on, with the influx of Chinese immigrants during the early 20th century, the community bloomed into a kampong known as Kampong San Teng.4 However, even with the rise of new landmarks – a Chinese school, traditional teahouse, wet market, and an open-air cinema, the highlight of village life still revolved around the annual festivals for the dead, including Double Ninth Festival (重阳节), Qing Ming Festival (清明节) and the Hungry Ghost Festival (中元节).5\nA crowd outside Kwong Wai Siew Peck San Theng during the Qing Ming Festival, 1988. Image courtesy of Kwong Wai Siew Peck San Theng.\nBe it cutting the grass to find the graves, preparing food in the teahouse or setting up theatrical performances or rites, the entire community would engage and interact with the dead during these three festivals. While most would have heard about the Qing Ming and Hungry Ghost festivals, not many people today know about the Taoist Double Ninth Festival. The Double Ninth Festival is held on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month. During this festival, people would carry a dogwood plant, climb the hills, drink chrysanthemum wine, and eat chong yang (重阳) cake.6 Many believed that the higher one climbed, the more successful one would be.7 In addition, Kampong San Teng would also organise theatrical performances (getai), lion dances, and sacrifices and offerings for the spirits. Even secret societies would participate in this festival. However, instead of commemorating Huan Jing, a mythological hero who defeated an evil monster, the local gangs would choose to worship a martyr who died while engaging in secret society activities. For smaller gangs without such martyrs, they would worship a deity called Ah Phoh San (阿婆神).8\nActivities that were associated with the dead did not only happen during these festivals. Being next to the cemetery, villagers interacted with the departed on a daily basis – often in various interesting and surprising ways. Children, for instance, played hide-and-seek in the cemetery without fear. Even when they fell into open graves, some would take the opportunity to “fish” from the graves! Loh Soo Har, a former villager and teacher at Peck San Theng Chinese School recounts:\nAs the village area was surrounded by trees, it was not so suitable to fly kites there, so we would go on top of the hills... Sometimes, when we accidentally broke the string of the kite, and had to chase after the body of the kite, we would fall into [empty] graves. Sometimes, we would discover fish in the graves. Usually, people would put a water tank beside the coffin. Strangely, catfish started growing inside, and I even caught a few myself. At that time, we even sold them for money! You could say that we took the cemetery as a playground!\nHowever, it was not as if there was no fear of the supernatural. Ng Su Chan, a former villager, recounts that his friend “walked into a ghost (and had) a high fever... for seven days, but miraculously after seven days, he recovered”.9 Such stories of other worldly beings and mysterious ailments were common and almost every villager had a personal story to tell.\nSecret societies, on the contrary, did not fear the cemetery. Rather, local gangs enjoyed a cordial relationship with the dead, resulting in much lawlessness in the area. The origins of this lawlessness can be traced back to Toa Payoh in the 1950s and 60s.\nToa Payoh then was popularly known as the “Chicago of Singapore” or the mafia district of Singapore. Much of these gangster activities spilled over to Kampong San Teng, which was considered an extension of Toa Payoh. Furthermore, the quiet and secluded nature of the cemetery made it ideal for secret societies such as Flying Dragon (飞龙) and Harmony Peace (和平) to carry out gangster activities there.10 This is illustrated in several incidences in the 1950s. On 25 June 1950, two men were caught with over one ton of unpaid-duties tobacco. In an attempt to arrest illegal distillers, the customs police, on 20 November 1954, faced off with a “menacing mob of 60 men armed with sticks”. The mob surrounded the police, allowing the criminals to escape in the scuffle.\nThe entrance of Kampong San Teng, facing Upper Thomson Road, 1958. Image courtesy of Kwong Wai Siew Peck San Theng.\nDue to its reputation for housing many secret societies, Kampong San Teng also became the logical place to investigate criminal activities, such as the kidnapping of multi-millionaire Tan Lark Sye’s nephew in 1957. These secret societies were also hostile to one another. Armed with parangs and guns, they often clashed with each other on the hills. The police were understandably hesitant to enter the cemetery and rarely patrolled the area, not to mention taxi drivers who avoided the place altogether. Peck San Theng cemetery, in one of the administrator’s words, was truly “messy and lawless”.\nSeeking Refuge among the Dead\nOn 13 February 1942, during the Second World War, a critical battle between the British and the Japanese took place on the cemetery grounds. On one side was the 2nd Battalion of the Cambridgeshire Regiment, 5th Royal Norfolk Regiment, 5th Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiments, and on the other, the lead elements of the Japanese Imperial Guards. The first engagement was a surprise hit-and-run bayonet attack at 11.30pm. Shortly after, the fighting intensified and both sides suffered heavy losses. Still, the 2nd Cambridgeshire Regiment managed to hold their position on knoll No. 90 (located somewhere between Pavilion No. 1 and 3). The final orders came on 15 February at 3.30pm: a half-hour ceasefire. Approximately two hours later, General Percival officially surrendered to the Japanese.11\nDuring the start of the Japanese invasion, especially after the bombing of Chinatown, many Chinese – most famously the Samsui women – moved to seek refuge among the tombs.12Their belief that Peck San Theng would be safer was unfortunately false. Not only did a fierce battle take place in Peck San Theng, the kampong was also bombed by the Japanese. Lim Choo Sye recounts:\nIt was the first time I had... such an experience of seeing how much damage bombs could do to a village... full of attap houses... it was an experience one can never forget, having seen so many houses flattened. A few people died, killed by the blasts, not so much by the bombing. There were a few limbs hanging on trees and all the trees had no more leaves.\nNevertheless, while the kampong cemetery was ravaged during the Japanese invasion, life during the occupation itself was rather peaceful. Compared to the urban city areas, the Japanese left the kampong cemetery relatively untouched. The place was spared due to a few possible reasons: the Japanese fears of offending the dead, the importance of the village as a food producer, and the perception that the rural Chinese were less dangerous than their urban counterparts. Those who sought refuge among the dead recalled that they were never called up for forced labour or screenings (Sook Ching operations) and lived a safe life in Kampong San Teng.13\nFrom Peck San to Bishan\nIn September 1973, the government issued an order to stop all fresh burials and closed the cemetery. Six years later, Peck San Theng’s land was officially acquired for urban development. The notice for exhumation was given in November 1979 and from 1983 to 1990, Peck San was redeveloped into Bishan Town.\nFamily members praying to their ancestors prior to the exhumation of graves at Peck San cemetery, 1980s. Ronni Pinsler Collection, image courtesy of National Archives of Singapore.\nKampong San Teng and its residents were also resettled to other new towns, with most moving to Ang Mo Kio.14 With the dead now occupying a much smaller space at the columbarium, how did modern residents go about living, interacting, or reconciling with the dead at the margins of the town? The answer seems to lie in both the architecture and the urban myths of the town.\nPeck San Theng may be physically gone, but its pavilions live on in the architecture of Bishan’s Housing & Development Board (HDB) flats. These iconic pavilion-inspired HDB roofs were popularised by Singapore’s sitcom series Under One Roof in the 1990s. More than a simple reminder about Bishan’s ghostly past, Under One Roof romanticised the ideal Singaporean life: living in a prime location 5-room HDB at with children who were well educated – a marked departure from the taboo of living with the dead.\nUrban myths about Bishan are yet another form of interaction with the dead. Just as how ghost stories were rife in Kampong San Teng, new residents of Bishan Town had their own supernatural experiences to share. These myths persisted and were even published in The Straits Times in an article titled “Is Bishan MRT ‘unclean’?”  \nIt is late at night and you are on the last train... The train, which is bound for Kranji, pulls into Bishan MRT station and you prepare to alight. To your astonishment, it does not stop. Furious, you confront the driver and demand to know why. He asks you how many passengers you saw waiting on the platform. 10 to 15, you say. He replies: “I saw more than 50 people and some were without faces. That’s why I didn’t stop.”\nEven today, Bishan station is considered one of the most haunted places in Singapore. There are many different stories of faceless, headless, or other worldly beings terrorising the station at night, all fuelled by the fact that the station does sit over former graves.15 Conversely, many also consider Bishan to be a place with good fengshui.16  As Kenneth Pinto puts it,\nWhen the place started getting more popular with people because it was quite central, then things got twisted around... Because of the cemetery’s high ground, you got good views, supposedly good fengshui. And, yeah, conveniently forget all these ghost stories.17\nConcluding Thoughts: The Dead as a Reflection of the Living\nIn many ways, the legacy of the dead is reflected in the lives of the living. Just as how the dead moved from jade hills to “condos”, the living too moved from kampongs to high-rise flats. What is currently home to some 90,000 Singaporeans was once an idyllic resting place for more than 100,000 Chinese migrants. Yet, in this process of turning squatters to citizens, many former kampong residents feel a sense of longing for the past; a sense that they have lost a familiar way of life, relationships, and people, in exchange for modernity and a new way of life.18 That is not to say that the choice to develop was wrong.\nAn aerial view of Bishan Town, 2018. Image courtesy of National Heritage Board.\nWithout having moved the graves, I wouldn't be able to live in Bishan and enjoy its modern facilities. But there is something nostalgic - even for a new resident like me - to be so closely associated with the dead. This nostalgia cannot be substituted by pavilion roofs or urban myths. Perhaps the best way to reconcile with the past to remember its history: just as how I remember the elusive great-grandparents that I \"live\" with today\nFurther Reading\n1.

From the world-famous chicken rice to the late night roti prata, the crowd-favourite laksa to the comforting flavours of nasi lemak, Singapore’s hawkers have been feeding generations of people from all walks of life. Hawker food plays a much greater role than just filling our bellies – it is a legacy that unites all Singaporeans.\nFrom Boon Lay to Maxwell and to Bedok, hawker centres have become the nation’s community dining rooms, where the office worker takes his usual morning breakfast perhaps in a hurry, while the retired senior digs into a bowl of noodles at his own leisure. Neighbours meet up regularly to catch up on news and gossip, parents dart from stall to stall to bring home their children’s favourite dishes, and grandparents reminisce about the good old days over a cup of freshly brewed coffee. It all happens right here.\nSo where did our Hawker Culture come from? What does it represent for Singaporeans? To really understand the Singaporeans’ love story with hawker food, we will have to journey right to the beginning, when our ancestors brought the very first hawker dishes from their homeland.\nHistory of Hawker Culture\n1800s – The Origins\nSingapore in the 1800s was a thriving port city which attracted migrants from China, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, and other lands, seeking a better life. They were hard labourers, merchants, clerks, and cooks who brought with them the comfort food they grew up with. They adapted these dishes to ingredients that were easily available here, and cooked them using local techniques, eventually creating a recognisable Singapore flavour.\nMany immigrants saw street hawking as a good way to earn a living, as it required little capital. These early pioneers started to ply the streets, serving the dishes that they were most familiar with. The streets were bustling with activity, colours, aromas, and flavours. Chinese hawkers would carry their mobile kitchens around, balanced on a bamboo pole along with their ingredients and utensils, so they could serve up piping hot meals on the go. Malay hawkers typically sold fruits and flame grilled meat sticks, a dish that we would come to know as satay. Indian hawkers added colourful sweets, cakes, and jellies to the street scene. One could even see a hawker walking his cow or goat on the street, ready to “dispense” fresh milk whenever a customer demanded.\nMalay hawker with his portable shop selling satay. (1907. Photo courtesy of National Archives of Singapore.)\nWith just three cents, anyone could afford a sumptuous meal of three to four dishes, served up at a moment’s notice. On the same street, one could easily savour the flavours from different parts of Asia, catered to local tastes. This vibrant beginning marked the first chapters of Singapore’s hawker story.\nUp to 1960s – A need for regulation\nAfter the Second World War, many who were unemployed turned to hawking as a profession, and that was when the street hawker scene became a thriving world of possibilities.\nA street side hawker, possibly selling pork innards soup and/or bak kut teh. Diners sit on wooden stools around the stall facing the hawker who would take their orders and serve the food hot from the pot. Hawkers usually wear cotton shorts or pants with white cotton sleeved tee shirts to keep themselves cool and comfortable. (1965. Photo courtesy of National Archives of Singapore.)\nHowever, not everyone shared the optimistic view of Singapore’s street hawker scene. In 1950, Governor F. Gimson set up the Hawkers Inquiry Commission and in the Hawkers Inquiry Report, it was stated that “There is undeniably a disposition among officials ... to regard the hawkers as primarily a public nuisance to be removed from the streets.”\nThe hawkers in Singapore during that time usually did not have easy access to water. This made it difficult to keep their utensils clean and prevent contamination by flies and rats. Without a properly assigned disposal area, hawkers often left piles of refuse on the streets, posing a threat to public health and hygiene. Many who were selling cold drinks, cut fruits, and ice cream used water and ice that might be easily contaminated, potentially causing outbreaks of cholera and typhoid.\nAnother issue the government faced was the challenge in street cleaning as the entire physical space where the hawkers plied their trade was viewed as a disorderly obstruction to traffic and city planning. As such, the colonial government started looking for ways to regulate the hawkers and relocate them.\nLate 1960s to 1980s – The first hawker centres\nAfter Singapore’s independence in 1965, along with the move to turn Singapore into the region’s business hub, the work of licensing hawkers and relocating them into more organised spaces picked up momentum. In 1968 and 1969, the government conducted an islandwide registration of street hawkers, issuing temporary licenses and moving them into back lanes, car parks, and vacant plots of land.\nStreet hawkers at Trengganu Street. After the 1980s, street hawkers no longer plied the streets as permanent hawker centres were set up. (1971. Photo courtesy of National Archives of Singapore.)\nDespite this move, illegal hawking remained rampant. In 1974, the Hawker’s Department Special Squad was formed to handle the situation. Public Health Inspectors, who were responsible for keeping illegal hawkers off the streets, were given handsets similar to those used by the police and could use them to relay information and seek backup assistance while CISCO officers escorted them on the ground. These new measures proved especially effective against the illegal pasar malam (night markets) that sprung up across the city.\nEnforcement was not all bad news. From 1971 to 1986, the government sought to relocate up to 18,000 hawkers to markets and hawker centres with proper amenities, so hawkers could have a safe and hygienic place to work without having to run from the inspectors.\nThe Housing Development Board (HDB) was responsible for the meticulous planning of every hawker centre to make sure that they were in well-populated areas. Each hawker centre was built within walking distance for most residents of the HDB estate, or a short bus ride away, while not being too close to one another. Chomp Chomp Food Centre, Block 51 Old Airport Road, and Tiong Bahru Market were among the first hawker centres to serve up mouth-watering Singaporean delicacies in this exciting new era of the hawker story.\nBalloting of market stalls at the old Kallang Airport estate. (1963. Photo courtesy of National Archives of Singapore.)\n1980s to present – Building a legacy\nThe five-year span between 1974 to 1979 saw 54 hawker centres built to serve residents and workers across the nation. Different architectural and design themes gave each hawker centre their unique touch. Newton Hawker Centre, for example, was built in 1971 with the idea of having “hawker stalls in a garden setting” with trees for shade, hedges and shrubs alongside a car park and a public toilet. The last food centre to be erected during this phase was Block 505 Market and Food Centre at Jurong West Street 52, in 1986.\nNewton Food Centre in the 1980s. (Photo courtesy of National Archives of Singapore.)\nToday, more than 110 hawker centres are located across Singapore, and there are plans to construct even more to better cater to our population (data extracted from the website of the National Environment Agency).\n“Hawker centres represent the culinary soul of Singapore, where everyone regardless of race and social background gathers for their daily meals. I grew up having meals at hawker centres and hope that my daughter gets to enjoy the same culinary experience as I do.”\nHugo Bart, frequent patron at hawker centres\nEven our hawkers have chosen to continue their family’s legacy by carrying on the trade that their parents or grandparents had started. More than half of today’s hawkers are second and third generation hawkers, most of them specialising in a particular dish, refining the recipes that have been passed down to them, and sometimes adding adventurous twists to their flavours.\n\nHaron Satay & Chicken Wing has come a long way from being razed by a fire in 2013 to the passing of their founder in 2016. Regulars nicknamed the satay as bakar-ed satay Haron as a tribute to the late Mr Haron Abu Bakar who founded the Satay in 1978. (2018. Photo courtesy of National Heritage Board.)\n“My customers are like my close friends; I can even say some are like extended family. As a hawker, I don’t just sell the food, I share the culture and heritage to my fellow Singaporeans.”\nMdm Muthuletchmi, Hawker at Ghim Moh Market & Food Centre\nGearing up for the Future\nThe Hawker Centres Upgrading Program (HUP) was launched in February 2001 to improve the dining experience at hawker centres, both for the hardworking hawkers and the patrons. Upgraded hawker centres enjoy re-tiling, new tables and seats, replacement of utility services, rewiring, improvement to the ventilation, bin centres and toilets, re-roofing where necessary, and provision of exhaust flue systems. Some centres even go through a complete reconfiguration or rebuilding. In addition to central freezer areas, central wash areas are also set up for sorting out used crockery. While the space is not air-conditioned to keep operating costs down and to preserve the traditional atmosphere and charm of hawker centres, barrier-free access has been prioritised to facilitate the movement of patrons in wheelchairs.\nThis is the Old Kallang Airport Hawker Centre which replaced the previous wet market in 1971. All stalls at this food centre are let out on rental basis and priority is given to residents of Old Kallang Airport Estate. Behind the row of stalls is the Mobil petrol station on Old Airport Road. (1983. Photo courtesy of National Archives of Singapore.)\nIn 2019, the government announced that 13 new hawker centres will be built by the year 2027. This new chapter would inject new energy into Singapore’s Hawker Culture, combined with the latest technologies in automation and sustainability, while preserving the heritage and authenticity of our hawker centres. The new hawker centre in Bukit Panjang, for example, is built with a trellis at its roof garden to allow for the installation of solar panels. Other sustainable features include a pneumatic waste conveyance system that will transport waste automatically to a central station through a network of pipes, so that cleaning would be more efficient and effective.\nBukit Panjang Hawker Centre features eco-friendly designs such as high roof ceilings for better ventilation, an open dining area to maximise natural lighting, and wide usage of louvres to utilise natural light while giving shade. It also introduces a green wall to promote a more sustainable ecosystem in the neighbourhood. (2020. Photo courtesy of National Heritage Board.)\nHonouring our Hawker Culture\nThe story of our Hawker Culture would never have been written if not for the passion of hawkers, and the support of community groups, the government, and food-loving Singaporeans. The rich culinary offerings of our hawker centres represent the Chinese, Malay, Indian, and other communities that call this country home. In recent years, international cuisine has also made its way into the heartlanders’ bellies. Patrons today can enjoy fish and chips, Japanese udon sets, Hong Kong dim sum, and even Korean kimchi at their favourite hawker centres.\n“Our family is always looking into new ways to excite our customers without losing the touch of our traditional roots. It’s not just food; we are serving a legacy.”\nAfiq Rezza bin Norrezat, Hawker at Ang Mo Kio Market & Food Centre\nSafeguarding Singapore’s Hawker Culture\nThere are four pillars to the safeguarding of Singapore’s Hawker Culture – Transmission, Research and Documentation, Support and Promotion. These are demonstrated through the collaborative efforts among government agencies, hawkers, training institutions, community organisations, academia, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and individuals.\nTransmission\nHawkers are encouraged to pass down their culinary practices to apprentices or family members. This is demonstrated through initiatives such as the Hawkers’ Development Programme, introduced by the National Environment Agency and Skills Future Singapore to teach aspiring hawkers about the culinary secrets of experienced hawkers, and to provide apprenticeships, to ensure that our hawker favourites will continue to be served for generations to come.\nComprising three stages (training, apprenticeship, running an incubation stall), the Hawkers’ Development Programme aims to equip both existing and aspiring hawkers with the relevant skills and competencies to run their businesses at #OurHawkerCentres. (2020. Photo courtesy of National Environment Agency.)\nResearch and documentation\nLocal food advocates and community organisations have been actively documenting the country’s rich hawker heritage and recipes of local delights. This culture has even piqued the interests of academics and experts. This rich library of publications, editorials, and multimedia materials continue to grow, providing the public with a comprehensive resource pool to further enrich their love for local food.\nSupport\nOrganisations such as the Federation of Merchants’ Associations, Singapore (FMAS), as well as other hawkers’ associations and representatives, work closely with the government to provide support and additional resources for our hawkers. The National Environmental Agency (NEA) has also set up an Incubation Stall Programme to encourage aspiring hawkers to set up their stalls with a lower start-up cost and pre-fitted basic equipment. Together, these organisations have also organised the Hawkers’ Seminar to encourage hawkers to come together to exchange ideas and strengthen the survivability of the culture.\nMs Chong Chiew Fung decided to give up her job as a quantity surveyor to venture into the hawker trade through the NEA’S Incubation Stall Programme. (2020. Photo courtesy of National Environment Agency.)\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic hit, support schemes, grants and courses on digital solutions were offered to help hawkers tide through the difficult period.\nPromotion\nHeritage and food enthusiasts, as well as museums and other organisations have launched exhibitions and campaigns to help promote Singapore’s Hawker Culture. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs), such as Slow Food Singapore, have also been organising different workshops and programmes to educate students and the wider community about our food heritage, while private entities like Eat.Shop.Play have tapped on digital and social media to promote hawker stalls in Singapore.\nKueh Appreciation Day hosted by Slow Food Singapore to build awareness and deepen appreciation of our local kueh and kueh producers who continue to produce these local delights by hand according to traditional recipes and techniques. (2016. Photo courtesy of Slow Food Singapore.)\nUNESCO Inscription of Hawker Culture in Singapore\nOur Hawker Culture resonates strongly with locals across all ethnicities and social strata, and it is also something that Singaporeans are proud to showcase on the international stage.\nOn 16 December 2020, Hawker Culture in Singapore was successfully inscribed as Singapore’s first element on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, with the unanimous support of the Intergovernmental Committee for the safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage. The inscription reflected our Hawker Culture’s significance in Singaporeans’ multicultural identity as a people, and as a nation, and affirms our commitment to safeguard it for future generations.\nFrom hawker plates to global palates\nSo, what does it mean for Singaporeans for our hawker culture to be inscribed as the UNESCO Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity? For the nation, it confirms our international standing as a culinary destination on the world map. For our hawkers, this is a recognition that their years of hard work have shaped Singapore’s culture for entire generations. For our food lovers, it is a testament of our passionate late-night visits to Chomp Chomp and our weekend trips across the island just to enjoy a bowl of laksa – a culinary love story that is forever written in history.\nHawker Culture in Singapore will continue into the future, so that our future generations can continue to enjoy the food passed down from our ancestors. (2018. Photo Courtesy of National Heritage Board.)\nFor generations to come, every Singaporean will continue to enjoy the traditional flavours from their heritage and various ethnic groups. Each bowl of soup, each plate of rice, and each cup of coffee – made with two centuries of passion and pride through the hard work and creativity of hawkers who adapted to the changing times and needs of communities.\nNotes", "comments": "unknown", "web_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/en/stories-landing/stories/Serving-Up-a-Legacy", "img_url": "https://www.roots.gov.sg/-/media/Roots/Images/Stories/Hawker-Culture/NHB_HC_Roots-Page-Banner.ashx", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:06:08"},
