,"This standing figure is a bodhisattva, a being who has postponed its own passage to nirvana in order to guide others to salvation. Bodhisattvas are often depicted as paired attendants to a buddha. This sculpture, too, was probably once worshipped as part of a triad of sculptures, positioned to either the left or right of a central icon. 
	
This bodhisattva stands on a stone base (the square plinth, two lions, and the lower half of a lotus-shaped pedestal) that was created for a separate sculpture of the historical Buddha, Shakyamuni. Several lengthy inscriptions on the base explain that an original sculpture was created in 570, and then another was installed at the same temple in 581, both utilizing this base. In 574, an emperor of the Northern Zhou dynasty (557–81) prohibited Buddhism in China, and many idols were desecrated. This may be the reason the base has some apparently intentional damage (two of four lions have been removed) and is no longer with its original sculpture. At some later date, the base came to be used for the present bodhisattva. In the early 1900s, it became the first work of Asian art to enter Mia’s collection.",China,571,Asian Art,"Standing Guanyin with lotus bud(?) in left hand, right hand missing, inscribed base which bears the date 571 A.D., translation of inscription filed with purchase blank, from Xi'an in Shaanxi province.",131,https://6.api.artsmia.org/131.jpg,Black marble with traces of pigments and gilding,,Artist,2023-05-09 15:52:39,Standing Bodhisattva,https://collections.artsmia.org/art/131
Artist: Bai Haonian,"Appreciated for their expressive ""brush play,"" ink monochrome paintings of grapevines and squirrels were first popularized in 13th century China. During the Yuan period (1279-1368), such paintings were used to ridicule the Mongol rulers who, like squirrels, occupied high places but lived in fear of people. The inscription of this work, however, indicates that it was commissioned by a Japanese patron in the early 20th century and, its artistic balance between formalistic and realistic concerns creates a heightened aesthetic tension remarkably different from the earlier prototypes.
The inscription reads:

,"This robust half-round table is an early example of a rare form. Huang-hua-li half-moon tables do not seem to have been made in great numbers and only a few Ming examples have survived. It is assumed that these tables were originally made in pairs to be placed together to make a circular table or separated and placed against a wall.

The sixteenth-century carpenter's manual, Lu-pan Ching, clearly sets out the construction criteria for such tables including the half-width back legs seen here that would form a whole when placed together with their mate. The solid construction of this table with its generous use of timber, supporting cross-stretchers, thick cusped aprons, and archaic style feet (called ""double-hoof"" feet) suggest that it is one of the earlier examples of half-round tables to survive.",China,early 17th century,Asian Art,half-circle table with 4 legs around rounded side; short barbed apron on front with curved supports below connecting legs,152,https://6.api.artsmia.org/152.jpg,Huang-hua-li hardwood,,Artist,2023-05-09 15:53:05,Half Moon Table,https://collections.artsmia.org/art/152

Artist: Zhu Chang,"Born in Anhui province, Zhu Chang lived mostly in neighboring Xin'an. While there, he studied with Hongren (1616-1663), the central figure of the Anhui or Xin'an school of painting. It was from that renowned master that Zhu learned the basics of his own technique and style. This scroll features the rectilinear and multi-faceted cliffs and elongated spreading pines characteristic of the famous Huangshan mountains of Anhui province. The linear, rather spare style capturing the fissured forms and surfaces of the rocks and trees, owes a great deal to Hongren as well as to the solitary nature of Zhu's own personality. Zhu is also said to have studied and copied works by various Yuan dynasty masters: their influence is observed in the extreme degree of simplification in his sparse landscape paintings.

Artist: Bian Shoumin,"Famous for his rather svelte ink paintings of wild geese, the professional artist Bian Shoumin also developed a more personal, less commercial style of painting grounded in the unassuming nature of literati art. Simple large images of fruit and vegetables fill the pages of this album. The point of these still lifes is hardly the importance of the subject matter—mushroom, turnips, or peapods—but rather the complex formal arrangement of pictorial elements and the rich and subtle techniques with which they are given form. In adopting this approach,Bian creates images quite distinct from earlier masters with a dry ink technique that resembles nothing so much as charcoal drawings.

Artist: Wang Rusheng,"The bare trees and wintry sky in this precisely rendered scene indicate that the season is winter and the temperature cool.

Attractive, easily understood, paintings like this were displayed throughout the New Year holiday season in China lending a festive air to celebratory activities.

The figurative style of Wang Rusheng is rooted in late Ming Suzhou artists like Li Shita (1549-1621). The legends of the seals that Wang used in this painting suggest that, in spite of his assured professional technique, he still saw himself as a literati.

Artist: Zhu Sheng,"Zhu Sheng was born in the modern city of Hangzhou in the Zhejiang province. He studied under Lu Dezhi (1585-1660), a specialist in bamboo and orchid paintings who in turn was inspired by the great Song dynasty masters of bamboo paintings, Su Shi (1036-1101) and Wen Dong (1019-1079). This background rooted Zhu Sheng in a rather pictorial approach to painting. The second edition of the famous ""Mustard Seed Garden Painting Manual"" featured Zhu Sheng's designs for bamboo and orchid painting and he enjoyed professional success while working in Nanjing during his later years.

,"Wenchang is the combination of two deified personages. The first is a local deity called Zitong who was worshiped in Sichuan during the Tang dynasty. The second is the deity of the constellation Ursa Major known by the Chinese as Kui. The reason why and how they became to be merged remains unclear, however, after the Tang dynasty the two became a single deity under the name of Wenchang and was venerated as the Deity of Literature. Wenchang is represented as a handsome man in the sitting posture. Sometimes he is also shown standing upon a fish, because the carp of the Yellow River is believed to make an ascent of the stream in the spring of each year, and those who succeed in passing the rapids of Longmen in Henan, become changed into dragons.

Born in Suzhou, Qian was orphaned at an early age and had little formal education until he became a pupil of the great literatus, Wen Zhengming. He evolved into an avid book collector and gained a reputation as a fine poet. While Qian often painted in Wen's style, his personal approach is recorded as having been derived more from that of Wen's teacher and friend Shen Zhou, the legendary founder of the Wu school.

The painting technique developed during Tang at this important ceramic center provides a northern precedent for the popular brown and white slip decorated wares of the Cizhou kilns which flourished during Song and Yuan dynasties (1280-1368).",China,9th century,Asian Art,"rounded body on raised foot; slightly inward-curving lip; surface decorated with abstracted floral shapes in brown glaze 5 on interior, 4 at lip and outer edge, separated by brown ovals",211,https://6.api.artsmia.org/211.jpg,Huangbaozhen ware Stoneware with floral décor in brown glaze on light white slip,,Artist,2023-05-09 15:54:14,Bowl,https://collections.artsmia.org/art/211
,"This handsomely shaped lidded bowl with vertical slightly inturned walls was a popular ceramic form during the Song dynasty (960-1279). The type was produced at several kilns in a variety of glazes.
The subtle color of this brown glazed ware, called kaki(persimmon) by the Japanese, was derived by a very high content of iron which forms a brown skin on the surface that contrasts with a darker color beneath the surface. The fact that the bowl is glazed down to the base, with the foot and interior also glazed indicates the earlier phase of this ware's manufacture during the Northern Song period (960-1127). The fine hard clay of the body suggests the Yaozhou kiln in Shanxi province as the likely source of manufacture.",China,11th-12th century,Asian Art,small round-bottomed bowl with short foot; sides slightly flaring inward; slightly domed lid with wide lip; small finial; brown glaze,212,https://6.api.artsmia.org/212.jpg,Yaozhou ware Stoneware with persimmon brown glaze,,Artist,2023-05-09 15:54:16,Covered Bowl,https://collections.artsmia.org/art/212
,"The short broad shape of this vessel, often described as a truncated bottle (tulu ping), is also found in celadon wares and brown glaze ceramics of the Song period (960-1280). The various Cizhou kilns of North China evolved an incredible variety of decorative techniques during this era. This bottle displays the brown and white coloration of most Cizhou ware but the combination of an incised pattern overlaid with a white slip which, in turn, is painted with brown floral decor is somewhat unusual. As Cizhou was not a court controlled ware, potters were free to experiment with different designs and techniques.",China,12th-13th century,Asian Art,"jug shaped with flat bottom; inward-flaring shoulder to narrow, short neck and flaring lip; white glaze with lightly incised pattern on body; 2 brown stripes and brown scrolling designs below a brown band with incised curves",213,https://6.api.artsmia.org/213.jpg,Cizhou ware Stoneware with incised decor under a white slip with painted iron brown design under a clear glaze,,Artist,2023-05-09 15:54:17,Beehive-shaped Vase,https://collections.artsmia.org/art/213

This was a common decorative technique at Cizhou kilns in North China during the Song, Jin, and Yuan dynasties (11th-14th centuries). More commonly, a dark-brown glaze was carved to reveal a lighter clay body, opposite of the light on dark effect seen here.",China,13th century,Asian Art,"pear-shaped body with long flaring neck; carved floral pattern; knife-cut, slightly flared foot; light tan glaze with light grey stoneware",216,https://6.api.artsmia.org/216.jpg,Cizhou type ware Stoneware with carved slip decoration under clear glaze,,Artist,2023-05-09 15:54:21,Bottle Vase,https://collections.artsmia.org/art/216

,"The earliest datable examples of carved rhinoceros horn are from the 8th and 9th centuries, although the Chinese had used the material pharmacologically much earlier. A solid mass of agglutinated hair, rather than a true horn, the substance was valued for its rarity and rich, warm chestnut color, which deepened with years of handling and polishing. Though called libation cups, these vessels would have been primarily used for display, and they would have been accompanied by beautifully crafted hardwood stands.

,"The Lung-ch'uan district in Chekiang province was an important center of celadon production from the Five Dynasties (907-960) through the Ming period (1368-1644).

A chief glory of far eastern ceramics, celadon was eventually produced in Korea, Japan, Thailand and exported from China to India, Persia, Turkey, Egypt and Southeast Asia. Accordingly, a characteristic of many post-Sung Lung-ch'uan celadons is that they are large, heavily potted bowls and dishes such as this one, which could withstand the rigors of transit over great distances.

,"Along with the White Tara, the Green Tara, as goddess of mercy and consort to Avalokitesvara, is one of the most popular deities of Tibetan Buddhism.

,"This sarcophagus, as well as the epitaph cover and the accompanying tablet, were reportedly recovered from a tomb located in Lijia’ao village, northwest of Luoyang in Henan province. Together they document an important stage in the development of the pictorial tradition in Chinese art. Buddhist, Confucian, and Daoist imagery intermingle within a landscape setting that anticipates the later genre of landscape painting in Chinese art. Along each side of the sarcophagus, amid trees and mountains, five scenes illustrate the Confucian virtue of filial piety, or respect for one’s parents, elders, and ancestors. Daoist and Buddhist imagery is prominent in the heavenly scene above: immortals riding on dragons, phoenixes, and birds. 

During the early sixth century in northern China, it was common to place stone memorial tablets in the tombs of the nobility. The memorial tablet bears an inscription dated to 524 and includes a biography and a eulogy to Yuan Mi (d. 523), whose sarcophagus this is.

,"As with many other types of bronze vessels, the ding had a pottery prototype dating back as early as the Peiligang culture of the Neolithic period (c. 7000–5000 BCE). Bronze versions of the flat-legged ding began to be cast early in the Shang dynasty (c. 1600–1300 BCE). The flat legs of those Shang ding were mostly shaped like stylized dragons. In the early Western Zhou period (c. 1046–977 BCE), it became popular for the ding legs to take the form of birds. In this example, the shallow bowl with a round bottom is supported by three flattened legs, each rendered in the form of a bird standing upon its claws and tail. Above the legs is a row of cicadas. Perhaps because the life cycle of the cicada was seen as symbolic of renewed life—they lie dormant underground for seven to 14 years, and emerge for only one summer—the insect was a popular motif during the Shang and Zhou dynasties, commonly represented in bronze and jades.",China,11th-10th century BCE,Asian Art,"Ting with supporting Animals, inscribed. Boldly modelled birds, hooked beaks facing outward and big horns facing inward, support a broad, shallow bowl with uprights. The body decor is in three belts, the two lower ones interupted by flanges corresponding to the supporting birds.

,"The he wine container is an old vessel type that emerged as early as the Erlitou period, dating from the 17th century BCE. During the late Shang dynasty (c. 1300–1046 BCE), its shape evolved—its bulging body, with narrow neck and spout, was supported by three cylindrical legs, as seen in this example. The vessel bears an inscription identifying that it was cast by “Shi” in honor of his father, “Gui.” Recent archaeological activities have established that all bronzes bearing the “Shi” inscription were cast during the late Shang and early Western Zhou periods. The vessel’s main body bears a decorative motif consisting of rows of scales in flat, double-band relief. It is generally recognized that by the mid–Western Zhou period (c. 976–886 BCE) Chinese bronze art began a process of stylistic transformation from that of the waning Shang to that of the distinct Western Zhou. Such change is marked by the replacement of taotie masks with patterned decoration. This vessel, however, demonstrates that in the early Western Zhou, the new decorative trend had already emerged.",China,11th-10th century BCE,Asian Art,"He, inscribed. Vessels of the He class vary according to the shape of the belly, which may be that of a Li, a Li-ting, or a Ting. This unique specimen has the hemispherical shape of a Ting. The handle, surmounted by an animal's head; the chain and its rings; the small handle on the lid decorated with dragon heads; the spout and the legs are very simple. The blade decor of the spout and legs, and the dragon motif in the neck and lid belts -- so dissolved as to leave only the eyes and interlocked double spirals as remnants of the bodies -- are in no way uncommon. In view of their off-hand treatment, the decor of the belly is doubly striking. It consists of rows of scales in flat,double-band relief, each scale being filled with a dissolved cicada motif in thread relief. This scale decor is a harbinger of the scale-band of the Middle Chou style. Therefore this vessel, with its cylindrical legs of the earlier periods, is best dated in the latter part of the early Chou, on the border of Middle Chou, i.e., circa B.C.900.

,"Jia were among the earliest Chinese bronze vessels cast during the Erlitou period (c. 2000–1600 BCE). Archaeological excavations have found more jia and jue (another type of wine cup) than ding cauldrons, which held food. This suggests that people of the Erlitou period emphasized the role of wine in ritual ceremonies. Jia became prevalent during the Shang and early Western Zhou dynasties (c. 1600–977 BCE) and gradually fell out of favor and then disappeared during the late Western Zhou (c. 885–771 BCE). It was fashionable in the late Shang to make square variations on originally round types of vessels—hence, a new type of jia emerged. Known as fangjia, or “squared jia,” it had a quadrangular shape and a rectangular or square cross section.

,"When this bell was made, around 500 BCE, Chinese bells had already evolved over 800 years. They were sophisticated musical instruments. This bell is called a yong, the quintessential bell type found in high-ranking late Zhou tombs. Unlike the bo type, seen elsewhere in this exhibition, it has an arch-shaped bottom, straight sides, cylindrical bosses, and a columnar shank (yong) with a loop suspension device that causes the bell to tilt toward the player rather than remain straight up and down. This permitted greater accuracy in striking than with vertically suspended bells—an important feature, since yong bells can emit two notes depending on whether they are struck in the center or midway to the side. The symmetrical group of bosses on each bell probably served to diminish the nonharmonic overtones emitted by the upper part of the bell, thereby emphasizing the fundamental notes.",China,late 6th-5th century BCE,Asian Art,"The decor of this bell, in cross section a pointed oval with an arched line at the bottom, is quite complicated. The shaft has three decor belts and one bulky ring with a vertically placed suspending device formed by a contorted tiger. The beast stands with body half raised against the shaft, its claws pressing against the lower of the three decor belts. The upper body and neck turn backward, with the tiger biting its own tail. The loop thus completed serves for the suspension of the bell by a strap passed through the loop. Of the three decor belts on the shaft, the upper displays a t'ao-t'ieh (to be seen from above). The two lower belts have dragons that turn alternately upward and downward. The bulbous ring supporting the tiger is decorated with a loosely twined cord pattern and interlaced lines. The top of the bell has rolled up dragons, their bodies formed of bands filled with voluted and triangles. In the two belts between the spikes on the outer surface of the bell are dragons placed alternately upward and downward. The decor field of the lower part of the bell is a magnificant specimen of gaudy Huai decor in which a t'ao-t'ieh bites on the body of a bird-dragon with a big, hooked beak, an S-shaped crest, and a heart-shaped horn.

,"This wine vessel is one of the most splendid examples of Eastern Zhou bronze art and technique. It is decorated with a geometric, brocade-like pattern of gold, silver, and copper inlay—actually, extremely stylized depictions of dragons and birds. As religious beliefs changed, ritual bronzes became more secular in use and decoration during the Eastern Zhou period. The fearsome taotie (composite animal) masks and symbolic animal motifs of the Shang and Western Zhou periods were increasingly replaced with abstract surface ornament such as “hook and comma” patterns, granulation or, as in this case, metallic inlay. It was done as much to delight the eye as to inspire religious reverence.

The head covering, rather like an open helmet, is broad at the back and rises to a peaked top before descending in a narrow tongue-shaped band at the forehead.",China,4th century BCE,Asian Art,"This small sculpture of a kneeling man holding a tube-like vessel in his extended hands is one of a group of similar figures that may have served as torch bearers in a tomb. The sensitively modelled face, with an expression at once tentative and hopeful lends credibility to this supposition. The figure is clothed in a close-fitting garment that wraps from left to right in a broad overlap and is belted with a narrow band. The head-covering, rather like an open helmet, is broad at the back and rises to a peak-like top before descending in a narrow, tounge-shaped band to the forehead. It is bound to the head by a strap that goes down in front of the ears and under the chin. A second strap passes around the head from the forehead to the occiput. This figure is one of a group of bronze sculptures found in the Han family tombs a Kin-ts'un near Lo-yang and reported by W. C. White in Tombs of Old Lo-Yang. The artistic tradition of the early Yin culture, modified by an approach to nature, still persists in some of these small bronze sculptures from the old Lo-yang area. Their general characteristics - the unvarying block-like form, the broad type with large round eyes, the details of costume, particularly the head gear, reflect a new interest in and a closer observation of nature. Such figures constitute the links between early Yin sculptures and those of Han time. Essential characteristics of the earlier works do persist, but in a modified form. One discerns also in these small works, as in some other early Chinese bronzes, a resemblance to certain examples of pre-Columbian art -- a kind of parallelism which points to a similar artistic disposition or a common origin, rather than to any direct influence or intercommunication between these centers of art so widely separated in time and space. However this paralleleism came about, it is clear that the sculptural products of Yin-Chou art reflect traditions of style no longer to be found in those of Han time.

,"Among the materials considered collectible by the literati, ceramic ranked the lowest. Among the vessels intended to contain water for writing, however, porcelain and stoneware far outnumbered other materials. Three basic types of pots became prevalent on the scholar’s desk for holding water: droppers, storage jars, and brush washers.
During the Kangxi period (1622–1722), the Chinese perfected a type of copper-red glaze, known as “peach bloom” in the West. At the same time, eight prescribed ceramic shapes for the writer’s table became popular. These sets included lidded seal paste jars, three forms of water bottles, open-mouthed brush washers, and beehive-shaped water containers like these. The literati admired such vessels for their purity of form and rich, variegated glazes. In this respect, early Qing literati taste echoed the refined aesthetics found in Sung ceramics of the eleventh and twelfth centuries.",China,1662-1722,Asian Art,"Water pots, pair, ashes of roses, with stands.",840,https://6.api.artsmia.org/840.jpg,"Porcelain with peachbloom glaze, bearing K'ang-hsi marks",,Artist,2023-05-09 16:07:12,“Peach bloom” Vessel for the Scholar’s Desk,https://collections.artsmia.org/art/840

,"This resting water buffalo probably served a utilitarian rather than a ritual purpose. The holes in the back suggest it was originally some type of support and part of a larger grave object.

,"The gui was the primary food vessel used in ceremonial rituals for offerings of grain. One of the most important components of the ritual paraphernalia, it was often coupled with the ding (another food vessel). The form was produced as early as the Anyang period of the Shang dynasty (c. 1300–1046 BCE) and developed into many varieties. This vessel, with its wide mouth, ample, bowl-shaped body, and C-shaped handles represents the typical gui of the Western Zhou. The flange forms the center of a taotie animal mask. The handles are topped by horned animal heads, and bird wings are carved in flat-band relief on the bow, thus giving the animal head a bird’s body.",China,11th century BCE,Asian Art,"The division into four panels is achieved by the hancles only in two places and in the remaining two places by small flanges in the foot belt, a slight ridge in the central belt, and free animals' heads in the neck belt.

This creature, done with a light touch, is surely one of the most urbane of its kind in the long history of Chinese bronzes. The winged dragons in the foot belt and the birds in the neck belt are, like the t'ao-t'ieh, in thr rounded relief on a bare ground. The handle, with a ramlike animal's head at the top, is adorned with birds' wings in flat band relief on the bow, thus giving the ram's head a bird's body. The bird's long tail descends vertically in the same relief, the end turned up. The bird's leg and foot come down in front, almost to the point of resting on the curled-up tail.

,"Used for holding wine and sometimes water, this piece represents a category of vessels in which a typical pottery shape has been translated into bronze. New technology accommodated precise decorative schemes—thinner vessel walls and more structurally sound knobs, handles, and pendant rings—than was possible in pottery. As bronze artisans continued to perfect their craft, vessels became increasingly elaborate, intricately cast, and varied in form.",China,1300-1201 BCE,Asian Art,"For this type of vessel the term Lei is confirmed by inscriptions. The Lei represents a vessel class in which a typical pottery shape has been translated into bronze. The decor, on a ground of spirals squared except for a single row of rounded ones, occupies four areas. In the lower part of the body is a band of large hanging blades, their borders scored, like flanges, with straight and T-shaped scores. Each contains two antithetical figures in flat, band relief. These are actually extreme corruptions of beaked dragons with bodies coalescing at the point of the blade. For this origin, see Karlgren Number 26, Plate 39 (50.46.101). Birds with cleft crests and heart-shaped horns alternate with whorl circles in the neck and lid belts. On the shoulder belt between are strongly stylized dragons with the same head serving two differently shaped dragon bodies a winged dragon on the one side, a dragon with curled-up tail and an extra plume on the tail end on the other.

,"A ladle like this would have been part of an elaborate set of ritual wine vessels of the Western Zhou. It would have been used to spoon wine into smaller vessels such as a jue. The handle is divided into three sections: a taotie (composite animal) mask just behind the bowl; a band of lozenges with a plain, narrow central ridge midway along the handle; and a rather elaborate arrangement of dragons at the end of the handle. The animal forming the final curve of the spoon is a dragon; its body bends violently to the left before rising vertically, its leg and claw on the outside of the handle.",China,11th century BCE,Asian Art,"The handle is divided into three sections: a t'ao-t'ieh mask, summarily executed, just behind the bowl; a band of lozenges with a plian, narrow central ridge midway on the handle; and a rather elaborate arrangement of dragons at the end of the handle. The animal forming the terminal curve is a dragon with a bottle horn and a body that bends violently to the left before rising vertically with a leg and claw on the outer (left) side. Toward the end it cleaves, one strand curling out into an ordinary tail, the other going on and ending in a second dragon head at the base of the mid-handle lozenge field. This dragon head has a big crest falling down along the back. The crest takes the shape of a bird, with a big V-shaped horn and a small crest connecting with the forehead of the first dragon a striking and ingenious composition.

The outer band of this bi boasts openwork designs of pairs of dragons and phoenixes, whereas earlier examples display incised designs in solid stone. On the other hand, the raised bosses toward the center of this bi (known as guwen or “grain pattern”) are simpler in comparison to earlier Western Han examples, which were accompanied by incised spirals that suggested sprouting grain—perhaps a symbol of fertility.

,,China,12th-11th century BCE,Asian Art,"The exuberent decor of this vessel is typical of the A style. In the neck belt, above two rigid rings, are two ordinary t'ao-t'ieh flanked by whorl circles. The t'ao-t'ieh on the throat has the usual features detatched from each other, but still conveying the idea of the image. An unusual detail is the S-shaped horns, here formed of snakes. The belly of the vessel is divided into four panels by flanges providing thecentral line of the owl's face, its beak protruding plastically from the flange. The horns are leaf-shaped, the eyes enormous, with pupils perhaps inlaid with precious stones. The owl's body, its wings adorned with scales, extends outward on each side from the flange, which continues to, and into, the foot belt. The thigh, a broad spiral, and the leg extending into the foot belt, are stiffly drawn. That the owl- at the same time one bird seen EN FACE and two birds seen in profile - here corresponds to the familiar t'ao-t'ieh, is emphasized by the fact that the usual flanking animals accompany it vertical dragons behind them. Under the owl's tail are head-turning dragons. In the lowest belt, snakes flank the owls' feet. The lid is semispherical with a band of spirals as the sole decor.

,"This tiger with socket clearly served as the base for an upright support of some sort.

These decor figures might point to a similar epoch were it not for certain details that are a clear indication of a later date.

,"Known as yazhang, this type of jade originated during the Longshan culture (c. 2500–c. 2000 BCE) in northeast China and was used as a ceremonial scepter until the Western Zhou dynasty. Yazhang scepters vary in their form and scale according to culture and geography. This yazhang has a long, narrow blade that curves slightly and ends in a nearly symmetrical, lunar-shaped cutting edge. On the other end, between the rectangular handle and blade, pairs of ornate teeth project beyond the edges of the scepter and are connected by incised horizontal bands. A central perforation has been drilled from one side at the stem of the handle. In its scale, shape, and toothed projections, this scepter resembles those from the late period of the Erlitou culture, which flourished in the central plains of China.",China,1600-1100 BCE,Asian Art,Dark olive green jade with light brown clouds.

,"This vessel is among the earliest gui with looped handles, which emerged in the latest period of the Shang dynasty. The surfaces of the vessel are divided into four vertical panels by four flanges on the foot and two flanges and two handles on the body. These narrow, thin flanges contrast sharply with the heavy handles and their massive bovine heads. The taotie mask on the belly is flanked by vertical dragons. The principal figures in the surface decor, executed in low relief except for the strongly protruding eyes, are so covered with embellished lines that they tend to merge with the ground of squared spirals. The vessel bears a single script inscription, “Shi,” which stands as an insignia for a clan. In recent years, a large number of bronzes unearthed in modern Shandong bear the same inscription, dating from the late Shang to early Western Zhou, thus revealing the location of this powerful clan whose members served in the court of the Shang king. It seems that the word originally referred to an official title.

It was largely during the early Bronze Age however, in Shang and Western Zhou, that some utilitarian weapon types evolved into a limited group of particular shapes executed in precious jade that held ritual significance in important political and social ceremonies. Most of the ceremonial jade scepters that have survived were buried in tombs suggesting they also held significance for the spirit in the afterlife.

,"Used by literati to impress their personal marks on documents and works of art, seals were among the most important scholar's implements. The literati often carved the legends themselves. Bronze and jade were commonly used for seals before the Yüan dynasty (1280–1368), but these materials proved too hard to be carved by anyone but professionals. In the Ming dynasty, soapstone became the preferred material of the literati. Scholars readily carved the soft material in their personal calligraphic styles. Like literati paintings, seals expressed the taste and personality of their owners. The squared, angular characters and simple, forceful calligraphy in these examples were inspired by Han dynasty (2nd century BCE–2nd century CE) script, which along with bronze inscriptions and other early styles of calligraphy was studied and emulated by the wen ren. The tortoise at the top of each seal often appeared in Han dynasty seals.

,"This gourd-shaped vessel is known as a yi and was used as a water container. Yi first appeared during the mid–Western Zhou dynasty (c. 976–886 BCE), and were prevalent in the later Western Zhou and Spring and Autumn periods (c. 885–476 BCE). Before conducting a ritual activity or sitting down to a ceremonial feast, nobility would wash their hands with water poured from a yi like this one. Archaeological excavations reveal that yi were often paired with pan basins. Later, in the Warring States period (c. 475–221 BCE), yi evolved from a footed vessel with rich decoration and an animal-mask handle, such as this one, to a simple flat-bottomed vessel with restrained decoration and a ring handle. The charming features of this vessel include the handle, surmounted by a horned dragon head, and legs, each one a seahorse-like dragon silhouette.",China,9th-8th century BCE,Asian Art,"The bowl is decorated in flat, band relief two belts with vertical scales below a broad upper belt of S-figures finished at each end with big tufts. These are probably remnants of strongly deformed dragons. At the end of the spout this band terminates in a dragon with a rolled-up nose. The scale bands stop short of this point and two large scales, placed crosswise, fill out the space. The legs are unusual in that those in front have a dragon's head, like that in the neck belt, whereas the hind leg is adorned with a big spiral such as usually emphasizes the hind quarters of an animals.

,"The gu is a tall wine beaker with an unusually taut and graceful silhouette—its trumpet-shaped top tapers to a slim center section before widening again to a slightly flared base. Archaeological evidence reveals that bronze gu first appeared during the Erligang period (c. 1500–1300 BCE) of the Shang dynasty. The gu enjoyed its greatest popularity during the Shang dynasty (c. 1600–1046 BCE), but became less popular in the early Western Zhou (c. 1046–977 BCE), before gradually disappearing during the Eastern Zhou dynasty (770–256 BCE). The gradual decline of the wine vessel may have something to do with the Zhou king’s deprecation of alcohol consumption—he believed that overindulgence in alcohol resulted in the collapse of Shang. This gu is decorated with variations of the taotie (composite animal) mask.

These hollow legs formed an extension of the interior cavity and were designed to expose the contents of the pot to heat most effectively. The li’s shape was adapted to bronze in the Shang dynasty (c. 1600–1046 BCE) and continued into the Zhou (c. 1046–256 BCE), but with thinner legs.

,,China,late 12th-11th century BCE,Asian Art,"Stout Wine Beaker,'Tsun', inscribed. A high degree of sophistication is evident in the decor of this broad beaker. In the foot and principal body belts it is disposed in six panels formed by six flanges with straight and L-shaped scores. The foot belt displays a dragonized t'ao-t'ieh with S-shaped horns, and a tail rising in an S-curve. The same decor occurs in the main body belt, where the vertical dragons under the raised tail are clearly visible. The narrow belt above has only three flanges, which form the central lines of dragonized, winged t'ao-t'ieh. The spaces occupied below by additional flanges are filled by t'ao-t'ieh in flat relief. All of these dragonized t'ao-t'ieh have T-shaped horns. The six panels on the shoulder, delimited alternately by flanges and big, plastically rendered rams heads, carry dragon figures with protruding eyes executed in exaggerated loops. In the lower belt of the neck, which has no flanges, pairs of consecutive trunked dragons facing to the right confronting pairs facing to the left. They have bottle horns and quills on their backs. Above, in the slender, rising blades, the decor filling consists of antithetical dragons with standing C-shaped horns, their trunk-like noses meeting in the median line, their narrow, band-like bodies joining at the tip of the blade and its filling is probably meant to suggest an eyed cicada, which it does in fact vaguely suggest.

,"The complex recessed pattern that covers this elegant vessel suggests that it may have originally been inlaid with silver or turquoise.

The animals which inspired the decor have been so corrupted and dissolved that the whole surface is a maze of lines, hooks, and spirals. Remnants of interlaced dragons are still discernible in the narrower bands, and occasionally, in the highly geometricized decor, a definite shape, such as the dragons flanking the central medallion, may be isolated. These medallion-like figures appear in the median line, with the decor pattern symmetrically arranged on each side. The middle one of the figures- best seen in the neck belt- is a t'ao-t'ieh mask with forehead shield, horns, and nostrils as seen in many appliques.

The “feather curl” pattern seen here exists in slightly different versions on many other late Zhou bronzes and seems to have persisted from about 600 to 250 BCE.

,"This small bronze statue demonstrates how images and styles spread throughout the Buddhist world. The depiction is said to be based on a sandalwood sculpture commissioned by King Udhyana in India during the lifetime of the historical Buddha (c. 400s BCE). A copy was brought to China in 405 CE and later transferred to the Da Shang Shou An Si temple in Beijing in 1289 CE. The casting of this miniature bronze shows Nepalese influence, a result of the Yuan dynasty emperor, Kublai Khan (r. 1260–94), who was a devout practitioner of Tibetan Buddhism (Lamaism).

Artist: After Wu Yuanyu,"By the Song dynasty (960-1280), the Chinese had perfected a pictorial art form called huaniao (flower-and-bird painting). Chinese artists combined a highly descriptive approach to rendering plants and animals with themes that had psychological implications. Based on a composition by the 11th-century artist Wu Yuanyu, this carefully executed painting of a swan and cygnets forms a pair with another scroll of the same subject matter. The compositions express a psychological bond between parent and child that is emblematic of the traditional Confucian value of family unity. Large, paired paintings such as these were commonly hung in the reception halls of aristocratic homes as well as palaces during the early Ming period.",China,14th-15th century,Asian Art,In style of Wu Yuan-yu (Sung Dynasty artist).,1498,https://6.api.artsmia.org/1498.jpg,Ink and color on silk,,Artist,2023-05-09 16:20:37,Swan and Cygnets,https://collections.artsmia.org/art/1498
Artist: After Wu Yuanyu,"This painting is typical of professional flower-and-bird paintings of the early Ming period in its clear reference to older Song dynasty styles. With the overthrow of the Mongols in 1368 and the restoration of native rule, the tendency to emulate the highly accomplished art forms of the pre-Mongol era was quite pronounced.

Wu Yuanyu, whose apocryphal name appears on this scroll, was a military officer in the Song courts of Emperor Shenzong (reigned 1068-1085) and Zhezong (reigned 1086-1094). He worked in the academy of painting and this portrayal of a swan and its cygnets, which forms a pair with a painting of the same subject matter, typifies the so-called Song academic style. Even though it was painted well after the time of Wu Yuanyu, it accurately captures the likeness and spirit of the earlier style.",China,15th century,Asian Art,"Painting dated 1103, but probably done later.",1499,https://6.api.artsmia.org/1499.jpg,Ink and color on silk,,Artist,2023-05-09 16:20:39,Swan and Cygnets,https://collections.artsmia.org/art/1499
Artist: Zhang Lu,"A scholar pauses to contemplate a waterfall as it cascades down the mountain, attended to by a servant boy, who carries his books. This traditional theme in Chinese painting relates to the eremitic genre, in which nature and solitude are celebrated as aims of an elevated, scholarly life. It also has religious evocations. The flowing water represents the essence of the otherworldly or immortal and embodies Daoist philosophy, which posits that the meaning of life can be sensed, but not fully understood or translated into language. The painter Zhang Lu adopted and developed the so-called ax-cut-like broad-brushstroke idiom, seen here in the depiction of the rocks, outlined with bold dark lines and washed with broad strokes of lighter ink.",China,c. 1525,Asian Art,,1500,https://6.api.artsmia.org/1500.jpg,Ink and light colors on silk,,Artist,2023-05-09 16:20:41,A Scholar Contemplating a Waterfall,https://collections.artsmia.org/art/1500

Artist: Unknown,"This painting bears an apocryphal signature of Yan Wengui, a highly regarded academic landscape painter of the Five Dynasties period (907-960). While few authentic works by Yan survive, his reputation was largely based on the towering ink landscapes that had come into prominence during his time.
The present painting is an excellent example of the popularity during late Ming and early Qing for large, carefully rendered color landscapes that evoked the monumental mountainous landscapes of the earlier Five Dynasties and Northern Song period (ca. 10th-13th centuries). The wealthy Ming and Qing merchant class created a demand for large-scale, carefully delineated, decorative scrolls such as this for use in their luxurious estates. Paintings such as these, carefully rendered by skilled, professional artists for an affluent audience were substantially different from the smaller ink landscapes produced by the scholar-amateurs for the literati class with their emphasis on personal brushwork and literary content.",China,c. 1700,Asian Art,,1870,https://6.api.artsmia.org/1870.jpg,Ink and color on silk,,Artist,2023-05-09 16:28:13,"Landscape in the style of Yan Wengui, c. 1700",https://collections.artsmia.org/art/1870

,"Tombs of Han nobility were often decorated with ceramic tiles bearing painted or impressed designs like this one, which 
probably served as a door lintel. This example was excavated during the 1940s from a site north of Luoyang, the capital of Eastern 
Han. The hunting scene in the upper central band, accompanied by a dragon frieze below, represents an early attempt by the Chinese to create a pictorial landscape. It also vividly illustrates the early idea of the sacred mountain being that of a dangerous and prohibitive space where heavenly and earthly spirits intermingled with ferocious animals and monsters. Through this mountain realm, which functioned cosmologically as an intermediary domain between heaven and earth, man communicated with heaven. Man also, at the time of death, ascended to heaven, often with the aid of shamans through this intermediary realm.

Like others in his circle, Wang Su declined to outwardly assert his individual identity, confining his expression to compositional clarity, exacting use of light color washes, and meticulous but unassuming brushwork.

His favorites were Li Cheng (919-967) whose influence can be seen here in the bare trees, and Zhao Mengfu (1254-1322).

Certain types of carved jade and silver vessels manufactured in India and popular in the Mughal courts found their way to China. The Indian floral and tendril motifs, along with a preference for openwork and thinly walled vessels influenced Chinese carvers, who responded by incorporating these motifs and techniques into some of their own work, like this censer.

,"This white tripod is of the highest standard in terms of pure color. White seems to have been the prized color in jade throughout Chinese history, but it reached a height in popularity during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This vessel has an exceptionally luminescent quality, and in view of this its maker has taken care not to clutter the form with detailed ornament, but rather provide a simple, polished surface that under strong light is totally dazzling. The tripod shape here is a vague reference to the ancient ceremonial bronzes of the early Zhou. This form, originally used in ancestor rites, was eventually revived and simplified to be used as Buddhist censers during the later dynasties of the Ming and Qing. Like the other magnificent jade burners in the Walker collection, however, this object was mainly cherished for the innate beauty of the stone itself.",China,late 18th-early 19th century,Asian Art,"The plain globular body carved with two projecting dragon-head handles at the shoulder supporting large loose rings and raised on three short supports issuing from two fu-lion masks, the domed cover with two fu lions for the finial.",4336,https://6.api.artsmia.org/4336.jpg,White jadeite,,Artist,2023-05-09 17:18:48,Covered Incense Burner,https://collections.artsmia.org/art/4336
,"Ironically, neither type of jade, nephrite nor jadeite, is indigenous to central China. All these precious materials had to be transported great distances from Chinese Turkestan in the extreme west or, in the case of jadeite, from northern Burma. This undoubtedly greatly enhanced the value and mystique with which the Chinese have always imbued this natural substance. The boulder shown here is typical of the type of raw jade, indistinguishable from most other rocks, found in the riverbed regions of Turkestan. The outer rinds of the stone has been ground away to reveal the color of the mineral beneath. It was thus prepared to be auctioned off to representatives of the jade-carving workshops, who bid according to the color, size and granular consistency of each piece.",China,19th century,Asian Art,The rock with one section ground to show the dark spinach-green color underneath the fray skin.

,"This bowl is an excellent example of intentional color alteration practiced during the late Ming dynasty. Toward the end of the sixteenth century, jade began to be quarried in the K'un-lun mountains near Khotan. This ""mountain jade"" was considered inferior in color to other types, so a practice developed of staining certain areas of the finished carving to increase its value. Iron-rich compounds were apparently used to create various shades of brown and black. Old literature also mentions burning jade as a way of altering color, and this nephrite bowl has most likely been treated with a combination of these techniques. The deeply carved melon and butterfly motif on the interior, symbolic of prosperity, is similar to designs found in carved lacquer ware of this same period.",China,17th century,Asian Art,"The opaque brown and cloudy tan-colored jade apparently burned in a fire, the shallow bowl with deeply rounded sides carved on the exterior and interior with butterflies and melon vine.

The artist has used the natural colors of the vertical strata to great advantage in depicting the paired dragons and the circular shou, or longevity, symbol that appears in brown against the white background. The rear of the vessel, though carved with identical motifs, is entirely white. The practice of highlighting aspects of a work by carving in accordance with existing color variations was already prevalent by the Song dynasty (960-1280). The technical mastery of Qing artisans and the greater variety of jade available allowed them to produce spectacular objects like this.

,"These two bowls would have been used on the scholar's desk as brush washers. The larger one retains the original surface of the boulder from which it was carved. This respect for the natural shapes and muted colors of nephrite perfectly reflected Ming scholarly taste. Used in China since prehistoric times, jade held ancient connotations for the literati. The scholar's preference for natural form and understated color stands in marked contrast to the aristocracy's desire for the larger, more intricatedly carved and brightly colored jades.

,"Used by literati to impress their personal marks on documents and works of art, seals were among the most important scholar's implements. The literati often carved the legends themselves. Bronze and jade were commonly used for seals before the Yuan dynasty (1280–1368), but these materials proved too hard to be carved by anyone but professionals. In the Ming dynasty, soapstone became the preferred material of the literati. Scholars readily carved the soft material in their personal calligraphic styles. Like literati paintings, seals expressed the taste and personality of their owners. The squared, angular characters and simple, forceful calligraphy in these examples were inspired by Han dynasty (2nd century BCE–2nd century CE) script, which along with bronze inscriptions and other early styles of calligraphy was studied and emulated by the wen ren.

Artist: Zhang Hong,"Born in Suzhou in 1577, during the full ascendency of the Wu school, the artistic temperament of Zhang Hong was undoubtedly affected by the literati painters around him. While he worked mainly in the literati tradition favored by the Wu school, he earned his living as a professional painter. Zhang's landscape paintings fall into two categories: those with complex composition and detailed brushwork and those with sparse compositions like this work composed with spontaneous strokes.
In what is a conventional theme of a scholar making his way along a mountain road on horseback, the artist has gone beyond mimicking outer appearances to create a rather ominous distortion of natural images. Zhang has manipulated the basic compositional elements to impart the majesty of the mountain scenery the scholar is experiencing.
While professional painting was effectively marginalized by critics like Dong Qichang(1555-1636), markets for professional-style painting persisted even in cultured cities like Suzhou.

These artists' small fan and album paintings demonstrate a balance of form, description, and decorative charm. Their technique generally rejects the use of ink outline and relies on the use of color alone (mu-ku or ""boneless method"").

The Tang preference for monochrome ceramics was rooted in the sophisticated tastes of the previous Sui dynasty (589-618) and its admiration for certain all-white wares. By discarding the complex shapes and flamboyant ornament associated with western Asiatic taste, Tang potters created green, white and black ceramics that reassert a native preference for simple forms and single uniform colors.

His robust and energetic calligraphy was highly prized. The exceptionally fluid characters, ""dragged-ink"" strokes, and well-modulated brushwork of this scroll reveal an incredible control of brush and ink and an individualistic spirit that was highly admired by calligraphers and literati of the late Ming period. His twenty-eight character verse reads:

The mountain's rocky girth has endured a thousand years, / 
A day has never passed without dragons and oceans, / 
Beneath heaven a verdant earth awaits benevolence, / 
Not knowing if clouds will settle here.

Artist: Qian Du,"Qian Du's father, Qian qi (died 1799), was a distinguished scholar. He was appointed governor-general of Yunnan province and also served as chancellor of the grand secretariat. Qian Du was given the classical education befitting a member of the literary elite and, for a brief time, served the government in Beijing as a second-level secretaryin one of the ministries. His personal taste favored the literati works of the early Wu school and he often modeled his paintings after Wen Zhengming (1470-1559) and others of the Suzhou group. For instance, the inscription on this meticulously rendered ink painting of scholars conversing in a thatched retreat by river states that it was done in the style of Tang Yin (1470-1523), also called Liu Ru, one of the most respected Suzhou masters of the early Ming period. 
The attention to fine detail and tight, descriptive brushwork is typical of Qian's style.

,"India's elite consumer markets attracted sumptuous objects made of fragile and costly materials from around the world. This plate was made in Jingdezhen, in Eastern China, from porcelain, a material not produced by India's own artistic ateliers.

Stylistically, the rider adheres to types found in contemporaneous Indo-Islamic manuscripts, while the elephant is oddly formed, as if its painter had never seen one before-or is it a conscious attempt to synthesize recognizably Indian and Chinese artistic styles' The borders of the plate contain white floral patterns punctuated by colorful exotic flowers, probably emulating the rich floral ornamentation that frequently decorated the borders of manuscripts. 

The owners of the vase or plate would have prized both possessions for their origins along global trade routes, in which India's political elites exerted significant energy and control.

Chen signed this painting with the seal “Daofu,” an alternate name. The work also bears three collections seals of the Qianlong emperor (who reigned from 1736-1795). The inscription on the paper mount is by a relative of Puyi, the last emperor of China. Typical of laudatory colophons, it reads:

Fans were common gifts among the literati and eventually came to be highly prized and collected as art. Folding fans were usually mounted on bamboo frames, which were typically removed so the painting could be mounted flat, as is the one shown here.

Artist: Wang Jian,"Wang Jian was from Wuxi in modern Jiangsu northwest of Suzhou on the Grand Canal. The son of Wang Wen (1497-1576), a legendary painter, poet, and calligrapher, Wang Jian received his jinshi degree in 1565 and worked on and off in government service for several years during which he authored many books. He was recorded as an excellent painter in the difficult baimiao (fine outline) style exemplified in this rare hand scroll of the Eighteen Lohan.

The original sixteen lohan or guardian arhats were enlightened individuals of Indian origin ordered by the Buddha to stay in this world to await the advent of the coming Buddha Maitreya. These sixteen, from an initial grouping of five hundred, were later joined by two more sinicised additions to from the Chinese set of eighteen, the jolly monk Budai and Damoduoluo (Dharmatrata). The theme of lohan crossing the sea traveling from the legendary island of Penglai in the eastern sea, to visit and influence mortal men, became a popular religious theme in the late Ming. The group is depicted here among strange sea monsters and demons in withering waves with exotic animals like the tiger, elephant, lion, dragon, Fu dogs, fish, winged horse, along with old sages and long-haired attendants.",China,"Wanli period, c. 1580","Chinese, South and Southeast Asian Art","fine line ink drawing of eighteen men crossing the sea, all by different means; means of travel vary from a man riding a horse to a group of servants carrying a seated man on an island",5194,https://6.api.artsmia.org/5194.jpg,Ink on paper,,Artist,2023-05-09 17:36:19,Eighteen Lohans Crossing the Sea,https://collections.artsmia.org/art/5194

,"The Chinese have used bamboo to create functional objects since the Stone Age. The material is inexpensive and extremely versatile. The Zhu bu, or Bamboo Treatise, from the third century describes how to use bamboo for food, the manufacture of paper, pipe stems, buckets, brush handles, medicine, and musical instruments. The excavated tomb of Marquis Yi of Zheng (433 BCE) yielded several wind instruments made of lacquered wood and bamboo. These included pan pipes, reed mouth-organs, and two transverse flutes. While much later in date, this bamboo flute is similar in size and structure to the one being played by the Eastern Han tomb figurine shown here. It is not certain when the bamboo flute was first used by the Chinese, but it was common throughout the Bronze Age and, by the Han dynasty, it seems to have gained popularity as an instrument for entertaining.

Originally, his already elaborate topknot would have been further decorated with a gilt-metal crown, although it is now missing. Avalokiteshvara is associated with mercy and compassion. His Chinese name, Guanyin, means “perceiver of sounds” and is an indication that this merciful being has the ability to recognize all the people’s cries of suffering.

Used for sitting, reclining, and sleeping, a low table could be placed on the platform to allow for eating and drinking, writing, or playing board games. Sleek and powerful, this beautifully proportioned couch avoids decoration, relying instead on its boldly outcurved legs, concave waist, and strong graining for its visual effect.

Artist: Wen Zhengming,"By the middle Ming, the influential literati painting movement known as the Wu school had developed in Suchou. Its spiritual founders, Shen Chou (1427-1509) and Wen Cheng-ming, represented a new generation of scholar-recluse. The theme of this painting and its accompanying calligraphy is based on the exploits of the legendary King Yu (d. 2197 BCE) who stemmed floods at Wu-ling in Shansi and became the first emperor of the Hsia dynasty. The site was later visited by Confucius (551-479 BCE) whose experience there was recorded by Chuang Tzu. Wen begins his own long poem here with the opening line of the ancient account written by Chuang Tzu.

Lu-liang, however, was in T'ung-shan county, Kiangsu province, near Wen's home in Suchou. Here the river is wide and unthreatening. Isolated houses, tiny hamlets, villages, and a walled town are all visible from the high vantage point chosen by the artist. Painted in his eightieth year, the landscape portrait probably commemorates a trip to the region or  place of residence of the recipient of the work.

Defining the highest scholar-culture traditions of sixteenth -century China, Wen Cheng-ming abandoned an official career to devote his life to literary composition, calligraphy, and painting. The calligraphic section of this long scroll is the best expression of Wen's brilliance. His brush moves across the paper with a swift fluidity instilling a sense of natural spontaneity.

Calligraphy
(Partial Translation)

        this I had heard of old but today now believe;
From the east it is said, appears water from the high Yellow River.
Downstream it flows, continuing directly to the precipice at P'eng Gate.

Artist: Xie Shichen,"A poetic passage of prose entitled Yufu or ""The Fisherman,""(c. 100-200 CE) tells a story of a fisherman who tried to convince Qu Yuan, an exiled scholar-official of the state of Chu in the late 300sand early 200s BCE, to give up his stubborn political ambitions and withdraw from social affairs. He said, “When the Canglang’s waters are clear, I can wash my hat-strings in them; When the Canglang’s waters are muddy, I can wash my feet in them.” The fisherman meant that a wise man should seek an official career in good times under a sage king, but withdraw gracefully when times are troubled and the ruler turns immoral. 

As opposed to more extreme ascetic self-denial, the idea of a temporary mental withdrawal, with the option to ultimately resume service of local or state authority, was a common theme in literature and painting. To scholar officials, landscape paintings such as this would offer a chance to temporarily experience the transformation from bureaucrat to recluse, to seek an awakening, at least for a moment, before returning their life in the office.

The colophon accompanying this view of a scholar relaxing his feet in a mountain stream reads:

 In deep seclusion the eastern wind blows fallen blossoms,
The whole river of spring water ripples with cloudy mist;
The wanderer's song has ceased and he is entirely at leisure,
Resting by an old valley pine while the sun has not yet set.",China,c. 1560,Asian Art,Man with beard and moustache sitting on the banks of a stream with his feet in the water; youth stands behind him; dense trees in middle ground and looming peak in background; inscriptions and two seals in upper right corner,6002,https://6.api.artsmia.org/6002.jpg,Ink and colors on silk,,Artist,2023-05-09 17:52:53,Bathing Feet in a Mountain Landscape,https://collections.artsmia.org/art/6002
Artist: Li Shan,"Li Shan, the painter of this landscape has long been considered one of the most innovative of the group of artists known as the ""Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou."" A talented writer, Li was appointed to service in the Imperial Academy in the early 1720s. A rather dissolute lifestyle led to a loss of his inherited fortune however, and by 1726 Li was living in Yangzhou in the Tianming temple struggling to earn his living as a professional artist. Li evolved a personal style based on heavily textured brushwork that gave primacy to purely aesthetic values. The present landscape is one of at least four extant paintings that were originally part of the same album. These works all show the influence of the famous artist Ba Da Shan Ren (1626-1705), a personal friend of Li Shan. The inscription reads:

Green trees grow thickly, shading mountain cottages,
I don't know if people are present in the
smart-weed blossom village;
I thought carefully the whole night through
and with rain from the river's source.
Washed forth the blue mountains
with close-knit dots and lines.

Gathering herbs was a favorite scholarly pastime, as it provided an excuse to interact with nature, which in itself could be a meditative process. More significantly it was a practice pursued by both Daoists and Buddhists, reflecting the idea of sacred mountains as places where potent alchemy could be practiced and meditative refuge achieved. The mountains also offered the opportunity to encounter immortal beings and therefore a path to transcendence.",China,1612,Asian Art,"2 figures, one very small carrying a basket, in lower left corner standing on a bridge; 2 buildings near top; tall trees in middle ground and mountains in background; inscription and 2 seals in upper left corner",6004,https://6.api.artsmia.org/6004.jpg,Ink and color on paper,,Artist,2023-05-09 17:52:55,Gathering Herbs,https://collections.artsmia.org/art/6004
Artist: Li Shizhuo,"Li Shizhuo was born in Sanhan in the northern region of Jehol which was part of the Manchu homeland.  Although Chinese by birth, Li belonged to a unique group of Chinese enrolled in the Manchu military banner system. Of the fifty-four Chinese bannermen recorded as painters and calligraphers, most followed the orthodox tradition defined by the great literatus Dong Qichang (1555-1636). While Li’s inscription cites the earlier masters Wu Chen (1289-1354) and Shen Zhou (1427-1509) as his models, this painting is a direct reflection of Ni Zan (1301-1374), one of the Four Great Masters of the fourteenth century. Li’s colophon reads:

People love Shi Tian’s (Shen Zhou) paintings and say that he succeeded to the hidden mysteries of Meidaoren (Wu Chen). However, they don’t understand that, in reality, this was the family tradition which he received from his father Hengji (Shen Heng, 1409-1477). Yesterday, I passed by Guazhou and, sitting at a rainy waterside window, brushed and dotted this picture which is conceptually between Wu and Shen.

The peony was a common motif during this period and one that archaeologists have shown was manufactured largely at northern kilns in the Guantai area, near the former Cizhou in southern Hebei Province.

The rare ""oil-spot"" glaze of this bottle was developed earlier at the Jian kilns in Fujian province during the Northern Song (960-1127). The dark brown-black glaze is covered with an ""oil-spot"" pattern comprised of numerous rust-brown spots each with a silvery metallic fleck in the center.

,"A boshanlu, or literally, Bo Mountain censer, was a type of incense burner that celebrated the mountain wilderness. A typical boshanlu has a bowl-shaped body, with a lid shaped like a conical mountain and a supporting vertical stem that stands on a circular foot. On its lid, mountain peaks are often represented by overlapping triangular forms, populated by animals and humans. Perforations, sometimes hidden between the overlapping peaks, release the smoke from burning incense as if mysterious clouds were rising from the mountain. 
This censer mountain features a monkey, tigers pursuing bears and dogs, and several men, one shown seated playing a qin, or zither, another playing the sheng, a reed instrument, and two riding horseback. These are Daoist practitioners who went into the mountains and lived in cave-shrines for the proper cultivation of personal immortality. Their depiction in the wilderness subverted earlier mountain imagery in which animals were often represented as a dominating force requiring reverence, and images of men showed them forcibly subduing animals.",China,1st-2nd century,Asian Art,"saucer with attached central stemmed container, decorated with dragons on foot; openwork lid with openings behind mountains with figures and animals",6155,https://6.api.artsmia.org/6155.jpg,Bronze,,Artist,2023-05-09 17:56:10,Boshanlu hill censer,https://collections.artsmia.org/art/6155

The teapot is decorated with a solitary fisherman standing on rocks from which trees grow next to a pavilion. There are mountains in the far distance. This pictorial scene of nature, undoubtedly inspired by ink landscape paintings, would have appealed directly to scholars who became the chief patrons of I-hsing ware during the early Ch'ing period.

Such spirit is also reflected in Lan’s composition: the portrait of the solitary cottage standing on a mountain amid a grove of trees.

,"Curious ""chicken-head"" spouts appear on a relatively large group of 4th century celadon and brown glazed wares produced at the Yue kilns in South China. The sculptural spouts had no symbolic importance and likely evolved from late Zhou dynasty bronze ewers.
This type of ewer with a robust globular body represents the style of Eastern Qin (317-420). With time, the basic form evolved into a taller, slender bodied vessel that was more often glazed in celadon. Likewise, the humble chicken head spout was transformed into more exotic birds including the pheasant and phoenix. Eventually, the bird heads were given more prominence, being raised from the shoulder of the vessel to terminate the elongated necks of the ewer or vase.",China,4th century,Asian Art,"rounded body; short, straight neck with flaring lip; tapering handle; pair of square decorative handles; chicken head spout; black glaze",6197,https://6.api.artsmia.org/6197.jpg,Yue ware Stoneware with dark brown glaze,,Artist,2023-05-09 17:57:00,Chicken-Head Ewer,https://collections.artsmia.org/art/6197

Song dynasty (960-1279) potters introduced a wide variety of decorative techniques to enliven the black-glazed stonewares that had been produced in China since the early Six-Dynasties (fourth century).

,"A large image of the Buddha constituted the centerpiece of nearly all sculptural altar groupings within Buddhist temples. In terms of Buddhist hierarchy, it is the most important image. It is typically larger than accompanying statues and is positioned higher on the altar. This golden Buddha is seated cross-legged in meditation with eyes downcast and hands in lap. 

The Buddha was an actual person rather than a god and, accordingly, such statues were not worshipped as deities. Rather, they were honored as symbols of enlightenment, human perfection, and Buddhist philosophy that pointed the worshipper toward a spiritual goal. Since the Buddha rejected materialism, he is typically shown with simple garments and no jewelry.",China,12th century,"Chinese, South and Southeast Asian Art",one figure from a larger temple group,6595,https://6.api.artsmia.org/6595.jpg,"Stucco, mineral pigments, gold, glass",,Artist,2023-05-09 18:04:58,Image of the Buddha,https://collections.artsmia.org/art/6595
