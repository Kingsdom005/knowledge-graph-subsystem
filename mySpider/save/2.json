In the early Western Zhou period (c. 1046–977 BCE), it became popular for the ding legs to take the form of birds. In this example, the shallow bowl with a round bottom is supported by three flattened legs, each rendered in the form of a bird standing upon its claws and tail. Above the legs is a row of cicadas. Perhaps because the life cycle of the cicada was seen as symbolic of renewed life—they lie dormant underground for seven to 14 years, and emerge for only one summer—the insect was a popular motif during the Shang and Zhou dynasties, commonly represented in bronze and jades.", "web_url": "https://collections.artsmia.org/art/816", "img_url": "https://6.api.artsmia.org/816.jpg", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:06:40"},

In the Ming dynasty, soapstone became the preferred material of the literati. Scholars readily carved the soft material in their personal calligraphic styles. Like literati paintings, seals expressed the taste and personality of their owners. The squared, angular characters and simple, forceful calligraphy in these examples were inspired by Han dynasty (2nd century BCE–2nd century CE) script, which along with bronze inscriptions and other early styles of calligraphy was studied and emulated by the wen ren.

In fact, the visual subtleties of monochromes stand in stark contrast to the polychromed exuberance of Tang tomb figurines. The Tang preference for monochrome ceramics was rooted in the sophisticated tastes of the previous Sui dynasty (589-618) and its admiration for certain all-white wares. By discarding the complex shapes and flamboyant ornament associated with western Asiatic taste, Tang potters created green, white and black ceramics that reassert a native preference for simple forms and single uniform colors. These aesthetic values, in turn, led to the great celadon and monochrome porcelains of the subsequent Song and Qing dynasties.", "web_url": "https://collections.artsmia.org/art/4698", "img_url": "https://6.api.artsmia.org/4698.jpg", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 17:26:13"},
