In the foreground an itinerant barber attends to a customer. \r\n Chinnery himself had arrived in 1825 at Macau some 70 miles below Canton at the mouth of the Pearl River estuary; from here he paid several visits to the Canton 'factories' between 1825 and 1832.\r\n   George Chinnery (1774-1852) was born in London, the son of a writing master with artistic ambition, who exhibited portraits at the Free Society of Artists in 1764 and 1766. Chinnery established himself as a miniature painter (small portraits in watercolour on ivory), exhibiting miniature portraits at the Royal Academy from 1791 to 1795.  In 1796 he moved to Dublin, where he had some relations, marrying there in 1799.  He began to paint landscapes and large portraits in oil. The abolition of the Irish parliament in 1800 led many of Dublin's wealthier inhabitants to leave the city, and perhaps for this reason, fearing the loss of potential patrons, Chinnery also left.  In 1802 he received permission from the East India company to travel from England to India, where he worked as a painter, leaving his wife and children behind in Britain.  He was initially based in Madras with his elder brother, a merchant and employee of the East India Company. Gradually he received more prestigious portrait commissions, and by 1812 he was established in Calcutta as the principal Western artist in the capital of British India.  His wife joined him there in 1818.  While in India he made many sketches in pencil of local life, people engaged in their everyday activities, and painted scenes of local architecture in watercolour.  Although he was successful and well paid, he was often in debt.  In 1825 he abandoned his wife and creditors and sailed for China.  He was based in the Portuguese enclave of Macau, which was to be his home for the rest of his life, apart from visits to Canton (modern Guangzhou), Whampoa and Hong Kong.  Trade between China and the West was centred on Canton, but Western merchants were only allowed to stay there briefly, and their families were based in Macau.  As in India, Chinnery sketched local scenes in pencil, painting finished topographical scenes in watercolour and in oil back in his studio.  He received commissions however for portraits of British merchants, especially those associated with the firm of Jardine, Matheson, and also painted Chinese, Portuguese, American, Swedish and Parsi sitters.  Chinnery's Chinese sitters included many Cantonese \"hong merchants\" who were responsible for all dealings with Western traders.  As Hong Kong developed in the 1840s the Western traders and their families began to move from Macau to the new settlement.  But Chinnery chose to stay in his home in Macau and died there in 1852 from a stroke.

He also established what was to become the largest photographic printing business in England.  This image is part of the V&A's Francis Frith 'Universal Series' archive which consists of over 4000 whole-plate albumen prints predominantly of historical and topographical sites.  Images such as these were highly desirable throughout the 1850s and 1860s. \n\nIt is now known that nearly all of the works bearing the F. Frith and Co. stamp were not taken by Frith himself, but by one of his travelling employees.  Photographers associated with Frith's 'Universal Series' include Robert Napper (Andalusia), Frank Mason Good (Egypt) and Frederick William Sutton and Hugo Lewis Pearson (Japan).  In addition to hiring his own photographers, Frith also bought the negative stocks of established photographers such as Roger Fenton and Francis Bedford.  \n\nThe images that make up the V&A Frith 'Universal Series' are file prints acquired from F. Frith & Co. Ltd of Reigate, Surrey.  Mounted on brown card, with the place name and stock number usually handwritten on the print itself, they were most probably used as place-markers within the company's filing system, allowing for easy retrieval of stocks of unmounted prints.\n\nFrith's growing business coincided with many technological developments taking place within the field of photography. These developments changed and expanded the audience for photography and Frith's operation was well-prepared to provide for it and, it can be argued, worked to develop it employing a diverse range of publishing channels.  Targeted towards a market that would later adopt the postcard as the ideal format for its needs, the 'Universal Series' forms a bridge between the initial low volume craft/art production associated with photography of the 1850s and the more commercial mass production work of the latter half of the century.", "comments": "Whole-plate albumen print from wet collodion glass negative", "web_url": "https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O215278", "img_url": "https://framemark.vam.ac.uk/collections/2008BW0908/full/!100,100/0/default.jpg", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 15:54:24"},

Accompanying the Anglo-French expeditionary force, which went on to seize Beijing and force the Chinese Empire to accede to sweeping political and economic demands, Beato’s views, combining topographical and military information, provided a visual record of the Imperial campaign.  They were often included in ‘progress’ reports sent from Hong Kong to the commanding officer of the British army.\r\n\r\nBeato also sold his images of China to British officers as unmounted prints with his stock number, title, and date written in pencil on the verso of each print.  By assembling a selection of images, the purchaser could construct a personal visual record.  Surviving albums such as this one have differing numbers of prints, and are a reflection of the owner's personal military career.  But even before the ‘narrative’ was constructed by the purchaser, Beato himself controlled the story, determining what was considered worthy of recording and eliminating any conflicting viewpoints. These views were absorbed by the public as part of a larger visual memory documenting England’s rise as an Imperial power.\r\n", "comments": "Albumen print from wet collodion on glass negative", "web_url": "https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1096298", "img_url": "https://framemark.vam.ac.uk/collections/2015HV7836/full/!100,100/0/default.jpg", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 15:56:28"},

It is part of the Robert Freidus collection of paper models, donated to the museum.\r\n\r\nThe Robert Freidus Paper Model Collection contains in excess of 12,000 models of architectural structures. These models remain in their unmade state. The models vary from simple press-out shapes, to more complex objects that require cutting, folding and sticking to produce their intended shape. The models come in various forms; boxed sets, postcards, pages from magazines, and jig-saw puzzles. The collection includes a large number of famous landmarks, versions of which have been produced by many manufacturers. But some models are less well known, including fictional locations from television programmes, and one amateur designer’s own house. Some publishers focus on a specific genre of buildings such as lighthouses while others set out to illustrate types of houses and buildings rather than specific examples.\r\n\r\nThe first paper models, those to be cut out from a sheet and assembled, appeared in Europe in the 17th Century, The earliest commercial models were recorded appearing in French toy catalogues in 1800. From then on paper models became popular across Europe particularly in Germany, and in the later half of the century, the UK. Manufacturers such as Pellerin and Schreiber began producing series of hundreds of models, from famous landmarks to farmhouses and specific scenes. Originally designed for children, paper models gave their owners the chance to learn about places and people in other parts of the world. The best example of this is Milton Bradley’s Village series produced in the late 19th and early 20th Century, which showed the people of a particular country and the houses they lived in. \r\n\r\nTowards the end of the 20th Century paper modelling became increasingly popular with an adult audience with many kits being designed for a more sophisticated modeller. During this time television tie-ins also started appearing on the market reflecting the emerging trend of media merchandising. More recently with the development of the Internet, models have appeared online and these have been printed and added to the collection. Some of these models are stand alone items, while others can be used with model railways or in fantasy role playing games.

She completed her BA in Ceramic Art at the Nanjing University of the Arts and her MA at the Jingdezhen Ceramic Institute. She has received critical acclaim both in China and abroad, notably in winning the Sidney Myer Fund Premier Award at the Shepparton Art Museum, Victoria, Australia, in 2004, and participating in the international exhibition 1001 Cups in 2010 that travelled from Switzerland to India, China and Korea.\n\nFrom around 2003, Jiang started to create anthropomorphic forms using moulded ceramic vessels, usually in the shape of ancient Chinese figurines. In 2012, she began the Banquet series during her residency at Gaochun Ceramic Factory in Jiangsu province that produces bone china tableware. Using the factory’s raw material, Jiang developed her ideas further by incorporating shapes from the factory’s mass produced tableware in her works, such as the knob on the teapot lid, which are visible in this piece. There is an element of humour in her pieces, as the solemn shapes that are reminiscent of Han-dynasty tomb figurines are reconstructed in cartoonish forms. At the same time, the piece speaks to the centrality of vessels in the performance of ritualised social relationships, in the past, and in contemporary life.

Mounted on brown card, with the place name and stock number usually handwritten on the print itself, they were most probably used as place-markers within the company's filing system, allowing for easy retrieval of stocks of unmounted prints.\n\nFrith's growing business coincided with many technological developments taking place within the field of photography. These developments changed and expanded the audience for photography and Frith's operation was well-prepared to provide for it and, it can be argued, worked to develop it employing a diverse range of publishing channels.  Targeted towards a market that would later adopt the postcard as the ideal format for its needs, the 'Universal Series' forms a bridge between the initial low volume craft/art production associated with photography of the 1850s and the more commercial mass production work of the latter half of the century.", "comments": "Whole-plate albumen print from wet collodion glass negative", "web_url": "https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O215275", "img_url": "https://framemark.vam.ac.uk/collections/2008BW0905/full/!100,100/0/default.jpg", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:03:41"},

It was designed by Shelley Art Director, Eric Slater, who studied under Gordon Forsyth, an advocate of improvement in industrial design. Slater's slightly earlier 'Vogue' shape, though very modern and fashionably geometric, received some criticism for its infilled triangular cup handles which people found difficult to hold. Slater responded to the criticism with 'Regent', designed in 1932, and it soon became the most popular Shelley design. Selected by Gordon Forsyth to represent good design in his book <i>Twenties Ceramics</i>, its printed patterns were enhanced with enamel painting.

The replica was specially made for the Museum of Manufactures at Marlborough House. It was acquired because of its 'successful turquoise colour' and as an example of 'the highest state of English ceramic manufacture'. Queen Victoria had been so struck by the appearance of the original service when she attended the preview of the Great Exhibition that she purchased it. After the close of the Exhibition she presented it to the Emperor of Austria. It can now be seen in the Hofsilber -und Tafelkammer at the Hofburg in Vienna.\r\n\r\nThe combination of glazed and decorated bone china with unglazed Parian figures was praised by the Great Exhibition jury for its 'original design, high degree of beauty and harmony of effect', though some objected to it. John Tallis, in his History and Description of the Crystal Palace (1852) also praises the 'bleu celeste' (turquoise colour) as being 'scarcely inferior to that of old Sèvres', which it was largely emulating.\r\n\r\nThe parian figures on this sugar bowl are the work of the designer and figure-modeller, Pierre-Emile Jeannest (1813-1857) who was the son of a French bronzier and pupil of Delaroche. He worked for Minton for several years between about 1848 and 1854. The painting was probably executed by Thomas Kirkby (1824-1890) who was a leading Minton painter and designer who spent over 50 years with the factory.", "comments": "parian and glazed bone china, painted and gilt", "web_url": "https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O180260", "img_url": "https://framemark.vam.ac.uk/collections/2008BT2264/full/!100,100/0/default.jpg", "submit_time": "2023-05-09 16:04:52"},
